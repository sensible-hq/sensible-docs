"Sensible falls back to the production version for each configuration if it can't find a development version."

smaller_test
prod has 3 fields
dev has 0 fields


bigger_test
prod has 5 fields
dev has 1 field

yes_prod__no_dev__current_draft
prod has 6 fields
current draft (not published in dev) has 8 fields (or 2 fields)

yes_prod_no_dev
prod has 7 fields
(current draft implicitly has 7 fields, no edits made after publish)


Specify dev:
----

Specify smaller_test which has bad dev and good prod: you get smaller_test dev 0 fields

Speicfy Auto select when you only have smaller_test and bigger_test -- you get  bigger test dev 1 field

specify auto select with all three -- you get back 5 fields which is prod bigger_test so wait whaaaat? I would expect to get back 6 fields for `yes_prod__no_dev__current_draft`

specify auto select with all 4 - got back 7 fields meaning yes_prod_no_dev DEV implicit draft
