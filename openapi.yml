    Extract structured data from PDF documents with the Sensible API. If you have any questions, 
    please reach out to support@sensible.so and we'd be happy to help you out.<br/>
    Sensible provides both synchronous and asynchronous endpoints for you to extract data out of your documents.
    <br/>The majority of our users can use our /extract endpoint, 
    which takes a PDF file and returns extracted data synchronously.
    <br/> Use the asynchronous endpoints for PDFs that are greater than 4.5MB in size or that require over 30 seconds of processing time. 
    <br/>You have two options for asynchronously processing your PDF: extract a doc at a URL you provide, our upload the doc to 
    a Sensible URL.  
    <br/>You can then call the `retreive results` endpoint to get the results, 
    or specify a webhook for us to push the results to as soon as they're ready.
    If you're new to APIs, then check out our [API tutorial](doc:api-tutorial) for a step-by-step guide to calling Sensible endpoints.

        Extract data from a local document synchronously.

        see [Try synchronous extraction](doc:api-tutorial-sync).
        
        There are two options for posting the PDF bytes.
          1. (often preferred) specify the non-encoded PDF bytes as the entire request body, 
          and specify the content-type as "application/pdf".   
          2. Base64 encode the PDF bytes, specify them in a body "document" field, and specify application/json for the content type.

      description: |
        Extract data asynchronously from a document with the following steps - 
        1. Use this endpoint to generate a Sensible URL.
        2. PUT the PDF you want to extract data from at the URL, where `SENSIBLE_UPLOAD_URL` is the URL you received 
        from this endpoint's response. For example, `curl -T ./sample.pdf "SENSIBLE_UPLOAD_URL"`. 
        Note: the pre-signed upload_url does not support Base64 encoded PDFs. You PUT the PDF bytes directly to the endpoint 
        and must omit the content-type header.
        3.  To retrieve the extraction or poll its status, use the extraction `id` returned in the response to call the 
        GET documents/{id} endpoint.
        You must use this or other asynchronous endpoints for PDFs that are over 4.5MB in size or require over 30 seconds to process.
        For a step-by-step tutorial on calling this endpoint, see 
        [Try asynchronous extraction from a Sensible URL](https://docs.sensible.so/docs/api-tutorial-async-2).

        The browser must either render the PDF as a full-page view with no other data, or download the PDF, 
        without prompting for authentication.

        The document type of the PDF to extract from. 
        Create the type in the Sensible app (for example, `rate_confirmation`, `certificate_of_insurance`, or `home_inspection_report`). 
        As a convenience, Sensible automatically detects the best-fit extraction from among the extraction queries ("configs") in the 
        document type.  For example, if you create an `auto_insurance_quotes` type, you can add `carrier 1`, `carrier 2`, and 
        `carrier 3` configs to the type in the Sensible app so that you can extract data from all these carriers using the same 
        `type`, without specifying the carrier in the API request.

        If unspecified, defaults to production. If you specify `development`, extracts preferentially using config versions 
        published to the development environment in the Sensible app. The extraction runs all configs in the doc type before 
        picking the best fit. For each config, falls back to production version if no development version of the config exists.
