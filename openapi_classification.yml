      summary: Classify document by type

      description: |
        Score a document's similarity to each document type you defined in your Sensible account and to each reference document in the highest-scoring type.
        To retrieve the scores, poll the `download_link` in this endpoint's response until it returns a non-error response.
        This endpoint is asynchronous. For more information about scores, expand the 200 response in the synchronous [classification](ref:classify-document-sync) endpoint.

        Use this endpoint:

         - In an extraction workflow. For example, determine which documents to extract prior to calling a Sensible extraction endpoint.
         - Outside an extraction workflow. For example, to determine where to route each document or to label each document in a system of record.

        To post the document bytes, specify the non-encoded document bytes as the entire request body,and specify the `Content-Type` header, for example,"application/pdf" or "image/jpeg".

        For supported file sizes, see [Supported file types](doc:file-types).

        **Note:** Use this Classify endpoint for testing. Use the asynchronous Classify endpoint for production.

        Score a document's similarity to each document type you defined in your Sensible account. Get scores for the document's similarity to document types and to their reference documents.

        Use this endpoint:

         - In an extraction workflow. For example, determine which documents to extract prior to calling a Sensible extraction endpoint.
         - Outside an extraction workflow. For example, determine where to route each document or to label each document in a system of record.
