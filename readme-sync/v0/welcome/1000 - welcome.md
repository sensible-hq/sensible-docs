Welcome to Sensible's documentation!  Sensible extracts structured data from documents, for example PDFs of business forms. Sensible combines a variety of approaches to extraction:

- You can use AI-powered low-code queries that use LLM models such as GPT-3, as if you were chatting with an AI bot about the document data you want to extract. 
- When AI can't handle your document's complexity, you can also extract document data using SenseML, a JSON-formatted, layout-based query language. 

With this blended approach, you can extract from a variety of semi structed, structed, and instructed documets, for example:

- **Out-of-the-box**  support for business forms, tax forms. We have a prebuilt library for extracting from things like: (list)
- **Build your own** extraction configurations for custom business forms or documents. Do you need to parse home insurance inspection reports? Medical research papers? Leases or other legal documents? You're covered.
