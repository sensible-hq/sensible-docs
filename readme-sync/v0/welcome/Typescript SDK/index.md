Overview
---

Use Sensible's Typescript SDK to extract structured data from documents.

**Quick example: Extraction**

The following example shows extraction code and the data it delivers:

```typescript
blah blah
```

Which returns the following from an example PDF:

```json
{some quick policy period or something}
```

TODO: image of PDF with extracted data highlighted.

These 3 lines of code perform the following before delivering the structured data:

- upload the document 
- use an existing config to extract the document. You've got to write the config yourself
- send the info to a webhook or back to you



Similarly, you can also classify documents with the Sensible SDK [TODO LINK]
