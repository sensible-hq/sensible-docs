Welcome to Sensible's documentation. Sensible extracts structured data from documents, for example,  business forms in PDF format. 

Sensible uses an extraction configuration, or "config",  to extract data from a collection of similar documents that you send to Sensible, either through our app or through our API. You have the following options for authoring configs:

| Use case                                                    | Description                                                  | Get started                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Low-code AI authoring**                                   | You describe the document data that you want to extract, using Sensible's visual authoring tool, *Sensible Instruct*. Sensible uses GPT-3 and other large-language models (LLMs) to extract data from your documents. | [Getting started with AI extractions](doc:getting-started-ai) |
| **Advanced authoring**                                      | To extract from complex document layouts, use *SenseML*, a superset of Sensible Instruct. SenseML is a JSON-formatted query language that combines layout-based queries with AI-powered queries. This combined approach lets you extract from a variety of documents, from highly structured business forms to unstructured legal or research papers. | [Getting started with SenseML](doc:getting-started)          |
| **Out-of-the-box extraction for common business documents** | No need to author configs for common business and tax forms. Use Sensible's pre-built, open-source [configuration library](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-configuration-library/) to extract key information from tax forms such as 1099s, major carrier insurance declaration pages, and other documents. Then tweak the pre-built configurations for your custom data needs. | [Getting started with out-of-the-box extractions](doc:excel-quickstart) |
