Welcome to Sensible's documentation. Sensible extracts structured data from documents, for example PDFs of business forms. 

Sensible uses an extraction configuration, or *"config"*, for extracting from a set of similar documents that you send to Sensible, either through our app or through our API. You have the following options for authoring configs:

- **Low-code AI authoring**: You describe the document data that you want to extract, using Sensible's visual authoring tool, *Sensible Instruct*. Sensible uses GPT-3 and other large-language models (LLMs) to extract data from your documents. 

  For more information, see [Getting started with AI extractions](doc:getting-started-ai).

- **Advanced authoring:**  To extract from complex document layouts, use *SenseML*, a superset of Sensible Instruct. SenseML is a JSON-formatted query language that combines layout-based queries with AI-powered queries. By combining layout and AI-powered queries, you can extract from a variety of documents, from highly structured business forms to unstructured legal or research papers.

   For more information, see [Getting started with SenseML](doc:getting-started).

- **Out-of-the-box extraction for common business documents:**  No need to author document extraction configurations for common business and tax forms. Use Sensible's pre-built, open-source [configuration library](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-configuration-library/) to extract key information from tax forms such as 1099s, major carrier carrier insurance declaration pages, and others documents. Then tweak the pre-built configurations for your custom data needs.

   For more information, see [Getting started with out-of-the-box extractions](doc:excel-quickstart).
