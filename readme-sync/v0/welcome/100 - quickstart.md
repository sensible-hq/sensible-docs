Get structured data from an auto insurance quote
===

Let's get started with Sensible! In this tutorial, you'll learn SenseML, a JSON-formatted query language for extracting structured data from PDFs. SenseML is powered by a mix of techniques, including machine learning, heuristics, and rules.

If you can write basic SQL queries, you can write SenseML queries. SenseML shields you from the underlying complexities of PDFs, so you can  write queries that are visually and logically clear to a human programmer.

 In this tutorial, you'll:

- [Write a collection of queries ( a "config")](doc:quickstart#section-create-a-config) to extract structured data from an auto insurance PDF 
- [Learn how the config works](doc:quickstart#section-how-it-works), including key concepts like lines, anchors, and methods
- [Test the config](doc:quickstart#section-test-the-config) by running your config against a second PDF
- [Use the API](doc:quickstart#section-integrate-with-your-application) to integrate your Sensible config with your application

Get an account
====

1. Get an account at [Sensible.so](https://www.sensible.so/get-early-access).  If you don't have an account, you can still read along to get a rough idea of how things work.

2. Log into the Sensible app at [app.sensible.so](https://app.sensible.so/) using your API key.

Create a config
====

1. Click **Create document type** and name  it "auto_insurance_quote". Leave the defaults and click **Create**.

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_doc_type.png)

2. Download the following PDF document:
   
   | auto_insurance_anyco_golden | [DownloadÂ link](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/blob/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/auto_insurance_anyco_golden.pdf) |
   | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

3. Click **Upload document**  and choose the generic car insurance quote you just downloaded.

4. Click **Create configuration**, name  it "anyco" (for the fictional company providing the quote), and click **Create**.

5. Click the configuration name to edit the configuration:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_click_config.png)

When the configuration opens, you see an empty config pane on the left, the PDF in the middle, and an empty output pane on the right:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_blank_config.png)

6. For this tutorial, let's extract only a few pieces of information:
   
   - the policy number
   - the policy period
   - the premium for comprehensive insurance

7. Paste in this config in the left pane in the editor to extract the data:
   
   ```json
   {
   "fields": [
     {
       "id": "policy_period",
       "anchor": "policy period",
       "method": {
         "id": "label",
         "position": "right"
       }
     },
     {
       "id": "comprehensive_premium",
       "anchor": "comprehensive",
       "type": "currency",
       "method": {
         "id": "row",
         "tiebreaker": "second"
       }
     },
     {
       "id": "policy_number",
       "anchor": {
         "match": [
           {
             "text": "policy number",
             "type": "startsWith"
           }
         ]
       },
       "method": {
         "id": "box"
       }
     }
   ]
   }
   ```

8. Click **Publish** to publish the config.

The following image shows this example in the Sensible app:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_config_1.png)   

You should see the following extracted data in the right pane:

```json
{
  "policy_number": {
    "type": "string",
    "value": "123456789"
  },
  "policy_period": {
    "type": "string",
    "value": " April 14, 2021 - Oct 14, 2021"
  },
  "comprehensive_premium": {
    "source": "$150",
    "value": 150,
    "unit": "$",
    "type": "currency"
  }
}
```

Congratulations! You created your first config!  If you want to process car insurance quotes generated by a different company, you can create a new config and upload a new "golden" PDF. 

- For a deep dive on how the config works, see [the following section](doc:quickstart#section-how-it-works).

- If you want to skip ahead and try out the API, see [Integrate with your application](doc:quickstart#section-integrate-with-your-application). 

How it works
====

- Each "field" is a basic query unit in Sensible, and the field `id` is used as the key in the key/value JSON output. For more information, see [Field](doc:field-query-object).
- Sensible searches first for a text "anchor" because it's a computationally quick and inexpensive way to narrow down the location of the target data to extract.
- Then, Sensible uses a "method" to expand out from the anchor and extract the data you want. For more information about defining complex anchors, see [Anchor](doc:anchor). 
- This config uses three types of methods:
  - [How it works: label method](doc:quickstart#section-how-it-works-label-method)
  - [How it works: row method](doc:quickstart#section-how-it-works-row-method)
  - [How it works: box method](doc:quickstart#section-how-it-works-box-method)

How it works: label method
----

To extract the policy period from this text:
![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_label_right.png)

The config uses the [Label method](doc:label):

```json
      {
        "id": "policy_period",
        "anchor": "policy period:",
        "method": {
          "id": "label",
          "position": "right"
        }
      }
```

This describes the data to extract:

- The anchor (`"policy period"`) is text that is pretty close to the text to extract, so it can serve as a "label" for that text  (`"id": "label"`). 
-  The text to extract is to the right of the label (`"position": "right"`).  

This config returns:

```json
    "policy_period": {
      "type": "string",
      "value": " April 14, 2021 - Oct 14, 2021"
     }   
```

You can extract text to the right, left, above, or below a label. For example, how would you use a label to extract the driver's name? Try it out.

Key concept: lines
----

See those gray boxes around the text in the following image?

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_concept_1.png)

Each gray box show the boundaries for a "line." Sensible recognizes lines using whitespaces (and other factors), so multiple "lines" can occupy the same x-axis. The Label method can operate within a single line, or across multiple lines.

So, let's ask a question: can you use the Label method to extract a line in the following image? 

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_concept_4.png)

For example, try using "Bodily injury" as the anchor text and see if it returns "$25,000 each":

    {
        "id": "doesnt_work_returns_null",
        "anchor": "bodily injury",
        "method": {
            "id": "label",
            "position": "right"
        }
    }

Try it, and it returns null.

This is because the Label method works only for closely proximate lines (sensitive to spacing and font size), or for text in the same line. In this case, the problem is that the gap between the two lines of text is too big:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_concept_2.png)

 Let's take a look at a purpose-built Row method instead to extract text in a table. 

How it works: row method
----

To extract this comprehensive premium of $150:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_row.png)

this config uses the [Row method](doc:row):

```json
      {
          "id": "comprehensive_premium",
          "anchor": "comprehensive",
          "type": "currency",
          "method": {
              "id": "row",
              "tiebreaker": "second",
          }
      }
```

This describes the data to extract:

- The anchor text (`"comprehensive"`) is part of a row in a table (`"id": "row"`).
- The returned value is a currency (`"type": "currency"`). For other data types you can define, see [Field query object](doc:field-query-object).
- The text to extract is the second line in the row after the anchor  (`"tiebreaker": "second"`).  Use tiebreakers to select lines in rows, including maximums and minimums (`<` and `>`).
- It's not shown, but the default behavior is to extract lines to the right of the anchor  in the row (`"position":"right"`). 

This returns: 

```json
    "comprehensive_premium": {
      "source": "$150",
      "value": 150,
      "unit": "$",
      "type": "currency"
    }
```

But wait! Why didn't `"tiebreaker": "second"` select $250 instead of $150, since $250 is the second line after the anchor (the first line is just a bunch of dots, "............")? 

The reason is that `"tiebreaker": "second"` evaluates *after* the data type we set in the field, `"type": "currency"`. So, instead of looking for the second line after the anchor in general, it looks for the second line *that contains a currency*.  Convenient, right? There are two such lines, $250 and $150, and $150 is the second one. 

Key concept: visualize anchors and matches
----

In the app, you can visually inspect anchors and methods by looking at their color coding:

- Orange boxes show lines matched by the Anchor object.
- Blue boxes show lines matched by the Method object.

To continue the Row method example from the previous section, in the following image the orange box shows that "Comprehensive" is the anchor line:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_concept_3.png)

Why are *all* the lines after "Comprehensive" colored blue, when the previous example output only included one line, $150?

The answer is that the Sensible app shows you the entire scope of the method match, not just what the method outputs. So the Row method matches *all* the elements in the row after the anchor, but then narrows down the actual output to $150 using `"tiebreaker": "second"`. Seeing the entire method match in the app can help you troubleshoot unexpected output.

How it works: box method
----

To extract the policy number from this box:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_box.png)

The config uses the [Box method](doc:box):

```json
      {
        "id": "policy_number",
        "anchor": {
          "match": [
            {
              "text": "policy number",
              "type": "startsWith"
            }
          ]
        },
        "method": {
          "id": "box",
        }
      },
```

 This describes the data to extract:

- The anchor is inside a box (`"id": "box"`).
- The anchor text  is "policy number".
- The anchor line is a little more complex than previous examples, because it also defines a match type (`"type": "startsWith"`). You can write a simpler string anchor as `"anchor":"policy number"`, or you can expand to complex anchors. For more information, see [Anchor object](doc:anchor).

 This returns: 

```json
  {
      "policy_number": {
          "type": "string",
          "value": "123456789"
      }
  }
```

**Note:** Sensible extracts the box contents, but not the anchor itself. In general, Sensible returns methods results, not anchor results (unless you define a [Passthrough method](doc:passthrough)).  Similarly, most Sensible methods ignore the anchor line (the line containing the anchor text) and do not include it in the output.

Advanced queries
----

You can get more advanced with this auto insurance config. For example:

- You can use a [Column method](doc:column) to return all the listed premiums ($90, $15, $130).
- The limits listed in the table (for example, "$25,00 each person/$50,000 per accident") are tricky for the Row method to capture since they can be a variable number of lines. Row methods depend on strict horizontal alignment of lines, so Sensible only extracts the first line. Instead, use the [Table method](doc:table) to more reliability capture the data in each cell of the whole table. Or, use an `xRangeFilter` parameter in the [Document Range method](doc:document-range) to capture the limits.  
- What if the document listed multiple emails, and you just wanted to capture all those emails? You could use a regular expression (regex) in your anchor coupled with a [Passthrough method](doc:passthrough), or the [Regex method](doc:regex).

To check out other methods, see [Methods](doc:methods).

Test the config
====

Before integrating the config with an application and writing [validation tests](doc:validate-extractions) against it, double check the config by uploading another quote.

1. Repeat the steps in the previous section to upload a second generic car insurance quote:
   
   | auto_insurance_anyco_golden_2 | [DownloadÂ link](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/blob/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/auto_insurance_anyco_golden_2.pdf) |
   | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

2. Click the **anyco** config, select the "auto_insurance_anyco_golden_2" PDF, and look at the output:
   
   Uh oh! It looks like this policy period spills over onto the next line, so Sensible misses the end year (2021). That seems like sloppy PDF formatting, but let's work with it. 
   
   ![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_error_1.png)

How can you capture the policy period reliably? 

**Document Range method**

As you become more familiar with Sensible, your first impulse might be to use the [Document Range](doc:document-range) method, which extracts multiple lines of text after an anchor. In this case, the PDF doesn't fit neatly into the Document Range method, because the date range is part of the anchor line (the orange box). As a result, the Document Range leaves out the first line of the date range and only extracts the year in the method match (the blue box):

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_error_2.png)

There's a workaround: specify to *include* the anchor in the Document Range method and filter out unwanted text in the anchor (the words "Policy period"). Try it out by replacing your existing `policy_period` field with this example:

```
   {
      "id": "policy_period",
      "anchor": "policy period",
      "method": {
        "id": "documentRange",
        "includeAnchor": true,
        "wordFilters": [
          "policy period"
        ],
        "stop": {
          "text": "for customer",
          "type": "startsWith"
        },
      }
    }
```

**Region method**

There are multiple ways to capture the policy period. Let's explore a completely new approach: a [Region method](doc:region). A region is a rectangular space defined by coordinates relative to the anchor. 

Replace the existing `policy_period` field with the following field in the Sensible app:

```json
    {
      "id": "policy_period",
      "anchor": {
        "match": [
          {
            "text": "policy period",
            "type": "startsWith"
          }
        ]
      },
      "method": {
        "id": "region",
        "offsetX": -0.1,
        "offsetY": -0.1,
        "width": 3.5,
        "height": 0.45,
        "start": "left",
        "wordFilters": [
          "policy period",
        ]
      }
    },
```

This field defines a region in inches relative to the anchor. Since the region overlaps the anchor, it uses `wordFilters` to remove the anchor text in the output. See the green box in the editor? This box dynamically resizes as you adjust the region parameters (such as  the Height and Start parameters), so you can visually tweak the region till you're satisfied. 

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_error_3.png)

Let's double check that this region also works with the first PDF:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_error_4.png)

Yes, it works too.

If you're feeling picky, try resizing the region using the green box for visual feedback, until the lower edge of the box doesn't overlap the customer service line in the first PDF (auto_insurance_anyco_golden_1.pdf). But even if you don't fine tune the region size, you can rest easy that you won't accidently capture the customer service line. This is because the Region method only captures text that is almost or completely contained in the region. 

3. Click **Publish** and choose **Production** to save your changes to the config.

In a production scenario, continue testing PDFs until you're confident your configs will work with the PDF document type you've defined. 

Integrate with your application
====

When you're satisfied with your config, use the [Sensible API](https://docs.sensible.so/reference) to integrate with your application. 

**Test the extraction API**

First, make sure you can extract data using the config and PDF you created in previous steps:

1. In your local file system, locate the the example [generic car insurance quote](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/blob/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/auto_insurance_anyco_golden.pdf) you downloaded in a previous step. For this example, use something like this to extract data:

```curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sensible.so/v0/extract/auto_insurance_quote \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/pdf' \
  --data-binary '@/PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_PDF/auto_insurance_anyco_golden.pdf'
```

2. **Important!** Remember to click **Publish** in the Sensible app to publish your config to production, or this request won't work:  

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_publish_config.png).

3. For an easy way to run this cURL request, download the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) desktop app. 

4. Copy the previous code sample.  Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key.

5. In the Postman desktop app, click **Import**, select **Raw text**, and paste in the code sample:
   
   ![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_postman_import.png)

6. Correct the path to your downloaded PDF: in the request, click the **Body** tab, select **binary**, then click **Select file** and select your PDF:
   

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_postman_1.png)

            "type": "string",
            "value": "123456789"
        },
        "policy_period": {
            "type": "string",
            "value": " April 14, 2021 - Oct 14, 2021"
        },
        "comprehensive_premium": {
            "source": "$150",
            "value": 150,
            "unit": "$",
            "type": "currency"
        }
    },
    "validations": [],
    "validation_summary": {
        "fields": 3,
        "fields_present": 3,
        "errors": 0,
        "warnings": 0,
        "skipped": 0
    }
}
```

**Note:** You don't have to specify the config you created (`anyco`) in this call. Sensible looks at all the configs for the document type you made in this quickstart (`auto_insurance_quote`), and **automatically** chooses the one that fits best! 

Now you can use the [Sensible API](https://docs.sensible.so/reference) to generate upload and download URLs for multiple car insurance quote PDFs,  retrieve results, and integrate with your application!
