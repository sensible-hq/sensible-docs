**Note:** If you're familiar with Sensible, this detailed topic is for you. If you're new to Sensible, see [sections](doc:sections).



The following images show the differing behaviors of sections vs vertical sections:

Sections

Sensible:

1. Finds the vertical range (y-extent) for a section in the group using Match and Stop lines. Range can span pages. if no Stop, next section's range starts at next Anchor:Match +yOffset. This ensures sectionsâ€™ ranges never overlap. 
2.  (repeats) Continues finding ranges for sections, searching down the page and across page breaks.
3. Extracts fields from each section in the group. Extract anything the y-extent (can include tables or other complex data); usually the data is in a repeated structure

 

Vertical sections

Sensible:

1. Finds the vertical range (y-extent) in which to recognize columns using Match and Stop lines. Range can span pages.  Ignores any non-column text above or below columns in the range, except if the Stop parameter is unspecified, uses non-column text as a criteria to end the range. 
2. (repeats) Recognizes columns based on whitespace, searching left-to-right. 

TODO: talk about how STOP parameter can influence column recognition??? if that's a thing?

Column Selection
----

Use the Column Selection paramter with vertical sections to:

- exclude columns from output
- use text in excluded columns as anchors for fields in the target columns. For example, if a table has row labels, then configure the Column Selection parameter so that the row labels become available to all target columns.


For example, if you configure `"columnSelection": [1,2]` for the following table, then the Apples and Bananas columns both:

- have the Nutrition and Notes columns available as anchors, where the anchors retain the spacial layout of the original table in relationship to the target columns

-  ignore other target columns when processing the current target column.

For example, you can specify a field in the vertical section like:

```
   {
        "id": "calories",
        "anchor": "calories",
        "method": {
          "id": "row",
          "tiebreaker": "first"
        }
      }
```

And return something like:

 ```
 {
   "fruit": [
     {
       "calories": 95,
     {
       "calories": 105,
     }
   ]
 }
 ```
