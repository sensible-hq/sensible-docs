Welcome! Sensible is a developer-first platform for extracting structured data from documents, for example, business forms in PDF format. use Sensible to build document-automation features into your vertical SaaS products. Sensible is highly configurable: you can get simple data in minutes by leveraging GPT-4 and other large language models (LLMs), or you can tackle complex and idiosyncratic document formatting with Sensible's powerful document primitives. 

TODO -- have a bit of an explanation of the 'developer platform' with callouts a la metrn?
