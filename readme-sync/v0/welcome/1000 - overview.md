Welcome to Sensible's documentation. Sensible extracts structured data from documents, for example PDFs of business forms. Sensible combines a variety of approaches to document extraction:

- **Low-code AI authoring**: Describe for an AI the document data you want to extract using Sensible's visual authoring tool, *Sensible Instruct*. Sensible uses GPT-3 and other large-language models (LLMs) to extract data from your example document. Save your description as an *extraction configuration*, and then you can extract from documents you upload to Sensible that are similar to your example.
- **Advanced authoring:**  To extract from complex document layouts, use *SenseML*, a JSON-formatted query language that combines layout-based queries with AI-powered queries. By combining layout and AI-powered queries, you can extract from a variety of documents, from highly structured business forms to unstructured legal or research papers.
-  **Out of the box support for common document types** support for extracting from common business and tax forms
