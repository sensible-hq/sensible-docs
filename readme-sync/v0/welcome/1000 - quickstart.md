Get structured data from an auto insurance quote
===

Let's get started with Sensible! In this tutorial, you'll learn SenseML, a JSON-formatted query language for extracting structured data from PDFs. SenseML is powered by a mix of techniques, including machine learning, heuristics, and rules.

If you can write basic SQL queries, you can write SenseML queries. SenseML shields you from the underlying complexities of PDFs, so you can  write queries that are visually and logically clear to a human programmer.

 In this tutorial, you'll:

- [Write a collection of queries ( a "config")](doc:quickstart#create-a-config) to [extract structured data](doc:quickstart#extract-data) from an auto insurance PDF 
- [Learn how the config works](doc:quickstart#how-it-works), including key concepts like lines, anchors, and methods
- [Test the config](doc:quickstart#test-the-config) by running your config against a second PDF
- [Use the API](doc:quickstart#integrate-with-your-application) to integrate your Sensible config with your application

Get an account
====

1. Get an account at [sensible.so](https://www.sensible.so/get-early-access).  If you don't have an account, you can still read along to get a rough idea of how things work.

2. Log into the Sensible app at [app.sensible.so](https://app.sensible.so/) using your API key.

Create a config
====

1. Click **Create document type** and name  it "auto_insurance_quote". Leave the defaults and click **Create**.

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_doc_type.png)

2. Download the following PDF document:

   | auto_insurance_anyco | [Download link](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/blob/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/auto_insurance_anyco.pdf) |
   | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

3. Click **Upload document**  and choose the generic  **auto_insurance_anyco** car insurance quote you just downloaded.

4. Click **Create configuration**, name  it "anyco" (for the fictional company providing the quote), and click **Create**.

5. Click the **Anyco** configuration to edit it. When the configuration opens, you see an empty config pane on the left, the PDF in the middle, and an empty output pane on the right:

Extract data
====


For this tutorial, you'll extract only a few pieces of information:

- the policy number
- the policy period
- a couple of premiums

1. Paste this config into the left pane in the editor to extract the data:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "policy_period",
      "anchor": "policy period",
      "method": {
        "id": "label",
        "position": "right"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "comprehensive_premium",
      "anchor": "comprehensive",
      "type": "currency",
      "method": {
        "id": "row",
        "tiebreaker": "second"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "property_liability_premium",
      "anchor": "property",
      "type": "currency",
      "method": {
        "id": "row",
        "tiebreaker": "second"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "policy_number",
      "type": "number",
      "anchor": {
        "match":
          {
            "text": "policy number",
            "type": "startsWith"
          }
      },
      "method": {
        "id": "box"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Click **Publish** and choose **Production** to publish the config.

The following image shows this example in the Sensible app:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_config_1.png)   

You should see the following extracted data in the right pane:

```json
{
  "policy_period": {
    "type": "string",
    "value": "April 14, 2021 - Oct 14, 2021"
  },
  "comprehensive_premium": {
    "source": "$150",
    "value": 150,
    "unit": "$",
    "type": "currency"
  },
  "property_liability_premium": {
    "source": "$10",
    "value": 10,
    "unit": "$",
    "type": "currency"
  },
  "policy_number": {
    "source": "123456789",
    "value": 123456789,
    "type": "number"
  }
}
```

Congratulations! You created your first config. If you want to process car insurance quotes generated by a different company, you can create a new config and upload a new reference PDF. 

- For a deep dive on how the config works, see [the following section](doc:quickstart#how-it-works).

- If you want to skip ahead and try out the API, see [Integrate with your application](doc:quickstart#integrate-with-your-application). 

How it works
====

- Each "field" is a basic query unit in Sensible, and the field `id` is used as the key in the key/value JSON output. For more information, see [Field](doc:field-query-object).
- Sensible searches first for a text "anchor" because it's a computationally quick and inexpensive way to narrow down the location of the target data to extract. For more information about defining complex anchors, see [Anchor](doc:anchor). 
- Then, Sensible uses a "method" to expand out from the anchor and extract the data you want. For more information about methods, see [Methods](doc:methods).
- This config uses three types of methods:
  - [How it works: label method](doc:quickstart#how-it-works-label-method)
  - [How it works: row method](doc:quickstart#how-it-works-row-method)
  - [How it works: box method](doc:quickstart#how-it-works-box-method)

How it works: label method
----

To extract the policy period from the document:
![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_label_right.png)

The config uses the [Label method](doc:label):

```json
      {
        "id": "policy_period",
        "anchor": "policy period:",
        "method": {
          "id": "label",
          "position": "right"
        }
      }
```

This describes the data to extract:

- The anchor (`"policy period"`) is text that is pretty close to the text to extract, so it can serve as a "label" for that text  (`"id": "label"`). 
- The text to extract is to the right of the label (`"position": "right"`).  

This config returns:

```json
    "policy_period": {
      "type": "string",
      "value": " April 14, 2021 - Oct 14, 2021"
     }   
```

You can extract text to the right, left, above, or below a label. For example, how would you use a label to extract the driver's name? Try it out.

Key concept: lines
----

See those gray boxes around the text in the following image?

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_concept_1.png)

Each gray box shows the boundaries for a "line." Sensible recognizes lines using whitespaces (and other factors), so multiple "lines" can occupy the same height on the page.

The Label method can operate within a single line, or across multiple lines. So, let's ask a question: for the preceding image, can you use the Label method to anchor on  "Bodily injury"  and return "$25,000 each"? Try it out:

    {
        "id": "doesnt_work_returns_null",
        "anchor": "bodily injury",
        "method": {
            "id": "label",
            "position": "right"
        }
    }

This returns null, because the Label method works only for closely proximate lines (sensitive to spacing and font size), or for text in the same line. In this case, the problem is that the gap between the two lines of text is too big:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_concept_2.png)

 Let's take a look at a purpose-built Row method instead to extract text in a table. 

How it works: row method
----

To extract the comprehensive premium of $150:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_row.png)

The config uses the [Row method](doc:row):

```json
      {
          "id": "comprehensive_premium",
          "anchor": "comprehensive",
          "type": "currency",
          "method": {
              "id": "row",
              "tiebreaker": "second",
          }
      }
```

This describes the data to extract:

- The anchor text (`"comprehensive"`) is part of a row in a table (`"id": "row"`).
- The returned value is a currency (`"type": "currency"`). For other data types you can define, see [Field query object](doc:field-query-object).
- The text to extract is the second line in the row after the anchor  (`"tiebreaker": "second"`).  Use tiebreakers to select lines in rows, for example maximum and minimum values (`<` and `>`).
- By default, the Row method extracts values to the right of the anchor. You can override the default by specifying (`"position":"left"`). 

This returns: 

```json
    "comprehensive_premium": {
      "source": "$150",
      "value": 150,
      "unit": "$",
      "type": "currency"
    }
```

But wait! Why didn't `"tiebreaker": "second"` select $250 instead of $150, since $250 is the second line after the anchor (the first line is just a bunch of dots, "............")? 

The reason is that `"tiebreaker": "second"` evaluates *after* the data type specified in the field, `"type": "currency"`. So, instead of looking for the second line after the anchor in general, it looks for the second line *that contains a currency*.  Convenient, right? There are two such lines, $250 and $150, and $150 is the second one. 

Key concept: visualize anchors and matches
----

In the app, you can visually inspect anchors and methods by looking at their color coding:

- Orange boxes show lines matched by the Anchor object.
- Blue boxes show lines matched by the Method object.
- Pale blue boxes show lines discarded by the Method object. Seeing the entire method match in the app can help you troubleshoot unexpected output.

To continue the Row method example from the previous section, in the following image the orange box shows that "Comprehensive" is the anchor line:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_concept_3.png)

The dark and pale blue boxes show you that the Row method matches *all* the lines  in the row after the anchor, but then narrows down the actual output to $150 using `"tiebreaker": "second"`. 

How it works: box method
----

To extract the policy number from this document:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_box.png)

The config uses the [Box method](doc:box):

```json
{
      "id": "policy_number",
      "type": "number",
      "anchor": {
        "match": 
          {
            "text": "policy number",
            "type": "startsWith"
          }  
      },
      "method": {
        "id": "box"
      }
    }
```

 This describes the data to extract:

- The anchor is inside a box (`"id": "box"`).
- The anchor text  is "policy number".
- The anchor line is a little more complex than previous examples, because it also defines a match type (`"type": "startsWith"`). You can write a simpler string anchor as `"anchor":"policy number"`, or you can expand to complex anchors. For more information, see [Anchor object](doc:anchor).

 This returns: 

```json
  "policy_number": {
    "source": "123456789",
    "value": 123456789,
    "type": "number"
  }
```

**Note:** Sensible extracts the box contents, but not the anchor itself.  By default, Sensible returns method results, not anchor results.

Advanced queries
----

You can get more advanced with this auto insurance config. For example:

- You can use a [Column method](doc:column) to return all the listed premiums ($90, $15, $130).
- The limits listed in the table (for example, "$25,00 each person/$50,000 per accident") are tricky for the Row method to capture since they can be a variable number of lines. Row methods depend on strict horizontal alignment of lines, so Sensible only extracts the first line. Instead, use the [Table method](doc:table) to more reliably capture the data in each cell of the whole table. Or, use an `xRangeFilter` parameter in the [Document Range method](doc:document-range) to capture the limits.  
- What if the document listed multiple emails, and you just wanted to capture all those emails? You could use a regular expression (regex) in a `"match":"all"` anchor coupled with a [Passthrough method](doc:passthrough), or the [Regex method](doc:regex).
- You can split the policy period into two dates, either by using the [Split computed field method](doc:split), or by setting the [Date](doc:types#date) type on the field and using a tiebreaker.

To check out other methods, see [Methods](doc:methods).

Test the config
====

Before integrating the config with an application and writing [validation tests](doc:validate-extractions) against it, double check the config by uploading another quote.

1. Repeat the steps in the previous section to upload a second generic car insurance quote:

   | auto_insurance_anyco_2 | [Download link](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/blob/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/auto_insurance_anyco_2.pdf) |
   | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

2. Click the **anyco** config, select the "auto_insurance_anyco_2" PDF, and look at the output. Unlike the first document, the policy period takes up two lines, so Sensible misses the end year (2021):

   ```json
   {
     "policy_period": {
       "type": "string",
       "value": "May 20, 2021 - Nov 20,"
     }
   ```

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_error_1.png)

That seems like sloppy PDF formatting, but let's work with it. There are several options for capturing the policy period reliably, including:  

- Document Range method
- Region method

**Alternative 1: Document Range method**

You can use the [Document Range](doc:document-range) method to extract the policy period. This method extracts multiple lines of text after an anchor. You need to configure some optional parameters, because the Document Range method by default discards anchor lines. Since the date range is part of the anchor line (the line containing `"policy period"`), you need to specify to:

- include the anchor with `"includeAnchor": true`
- filter out unwanted text in the anchor (the words "Policy period") with a Word Filters parameter.

Try it out by replacing your existing `policy_period` field with this example:

```
   {
      "id": "policy_period",
      "anchor": "policy period",
      "method": {
        "id": "documentRange",
        "includeAnchor": true,
        "wordFilters": [
          "policy period"
        ],
        "stop": {
          "text": "for customer",
          "type": "startsWith"
        },
      }
    }
```

**Alternative 2: Region method**

Alternatively, you can use the [Region method](doc:region) to extract the policy period. A region is a rectangular space defined by coordinates relative to the anchor. 

Replace the existing `policy_period` field with the following field in the Sensible app:

```json
    {
      "id": "policy_period",
      "anchor": {
        "match": [
          {
            "text": "policy period",
            "type": "startsWith"
          }
        ]
      },
      "method": {
        "id": "region",
        "offsetX": -0.2,
        "offsetY": -0.1,
        "width": 3.6,
        "height": 0.45,
        "start": "left",
        "wordFilters": [
          "policy period",
        ]
      }
    },
```

This field defines a region in inches relative to the anchor. Since the region overlaps the anchor, specify a Word Filters parameter to remove the anchor text in the output. See the green box representing the region in the editor? This box dynamically resizes as you adjust the region parameters (such as the Height and Start parameters), so you can visually tweak the region till you're satisfied. 

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_error_3.png)

Let's double check that this region also works with the first PDF:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_error_4.png)

Yes, it works too.

If you're feeling picky, try resizing the region using the green box for visual feedback, until the lower edge of the box doesn't overlap the customer service line in the first PDF (auto_insurance_anyco_1.pdf). But even if you don't fine tune the region size, you can rest easy that you won't accidently capture the customer service line. This is because the Region method only captures text that is almost or completely contained in the region. 

3. Click **Publish** and choose **Production** to save your changes to the config.

In a production scenario, continue testing PDFs until you're confident your configs work with the PDF document type you've defined.  Then, write tests to validate the extractions in production.

Integrate with your application
====

When you're satisfied with your config, use the [Sensible API](https://docs.sensible.so/reference) to integrate with your application. If you're new to APIs, then see [Try asynchronous extraction from your URL](doc:api-tutorial-async-1) for a tutorial.

Validate extractions in production 
====

In a previous section, we tested a few PDFs manually. Now let's scale up and quality control the extractions by writing a few tests that run for all API extractions in a doc type.

Use JsonLogic to validate that a few pieces of extracted information makes sense for the car insurance document:

- Test that the property damage liability premium is cheaper than the comprehensive premium:
  -  `{"<":[{"var":"property_liability_premium.value"},{"var":"comprehensive_premium.value"}]}`
- Test that the policy number is a nine-digit number:
  - `{"match":[{"var":"policy_number.value"},"\\d{9}"]}`

To add these tests:

1. In the **auto_insurance_quote** document type, click **Create validation**. Add the following input to the dialog:
   - Set the **Severity** to **Warning**
   - Set the **Description** to "prop. damage less than comprehensive".
   - Set the **Condition** to:

```json
{"<":
 [
     {"var":"property_liability_premium.value"},
     {"var":"comprehensive_premium.value"}
 ]
}
```

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/quickstart_validation.png)

3. Click **Create**.
4. Repeat the previous steps to create another validation with the following settings:
   -  Set the **Severity** to **Error**
   -  Set the **Description** to "policy number is a nine-digit number"
   -  Set the **Condition** to:

```json
{"match":
  [
      {"var":"policy_number.value"},"\\d{9}"
  ]
}
```



5. To test the validations with a PDF that is missing information, [try out an API call](doc:api-tutorial-async-1) with the following example PDF that has these errors:

   -  the policy number is missing
   -  the property damage liability premium is $200 more than the comprehensive premium

| auto_insurance_anyco_3 | [Download link](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/blob/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/auto_insurance_anyco_3.pdf) |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

You should receive a response with errors and warnings in the Validations array:

```json
{
    "id": "11404335-1ea4-4414-a5ca-1ccef568ebec",
    "created": "2021-09-21T17:36:56.339Z",
    "status": "COMPLETE",
    "type": "auto_insurance_quote",
    "configuration": "anyco",
    "parsed_document": {
        "policy_period": null,
        "comprehensive_premium": {
            "source": "$100",
            "value": 100,
            "unit": "$",
            "type": "currency"
        },
        "property_liability_premium": {
            "source": "$300",
            "value": 300,
            "unit": "$",
            "type": "currency"
        },
        "policy_number": null
    },
    "validations": [
        {
            "description": "prop. damage less than comprehensive",
            "severity": "warning"
        },
        {
            "description": "policy number is a nine-digit number",
            "severity": "error"
        }
    ],
    "validation_summary": {
        "fields": 4,
        "fields_present": 2,
        "errors": 1,
        "warnings": 1,
        "skipped": 0
    }
}
```
