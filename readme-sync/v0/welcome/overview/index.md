Welcome to Sensible's documentation!  Sensible extracts structured data from documents, for example PDFs of business forms. Sensible combines a variety of approaches to extraction:

- You can use AI-powered low-code queries, as if you were chatting with an AI bot about the document data you want to extract. 
- When AI can't handle your document's complexity, you can also extract document data using SenseML, a JSON-formatted, layout-based query language. 

With this blended approahc, you can extract from a variety of semi strucuted, strucuted, and unsturucted documets, for example:

- **Out-of-the-box**  support for business forms, tax forms. We have a prebuilt library for extracting from things like: (list)

- **Build your own** support for custom business forms. Do you need to parse home insurance inspection reports? archived tax reports? etc
