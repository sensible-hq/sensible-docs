Welcome to Sensible's documentation!  Sensible extracts structured data from documents, for example PDFs of business forms, using SenseML, a JSON-formatted query language.

Looking good. I think the alternatives section could be a bit more clear. The discussion here could be useful: https://www.notion.so/sensiblehq/Questions-talking-points-for-Sensible-Instruct-86d5c6ecc37146b399a94feee81a3d3c?pvs=4 



to position Sensible Instruct vs SenseML

Common business forms
----

 Get started in minutes using pre-built, open-source SenseML parsers to extract information from common business documents and forms.

Custom business forms
---

Write SenseML queries to extract information from your custom business documents and forms. If you can write basic SQL queries, you can write SenseML queries. SenseML shields you from the underlying complexities of PDFs.

Free-text documents

Walk through a guided tutorial on extracting information from an unstructured, natural-language document, or take a look at the reference docs.
