You can configure rules to trigger review for extractions that fail validations or have missing null data. Using our review UI in the Sensible app to manually correct the extraction then approve or reject it.

In a document type, in the **Human Review** tab, you can set the criteria for Sensible to flag an extraction for manual review:

You can enable human review for all documents in a type, or you can set criteria to trigger review. Criteria include:

- Extraction converage (2do link to /metrics)

- Validation errors and warnings, if configured. You can select all errors, all warnings, or choose which ones you want on an individual basis. 

  

After you run extractions in the document type, the **Human review** tab displays the document types that contain extractions flagged for review:
