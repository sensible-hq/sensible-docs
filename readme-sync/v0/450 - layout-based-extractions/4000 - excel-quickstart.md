TODO: better wording

If you want to extract from any of the following document types, then you can get started in minutes using the [Sensible configuration library](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-configuration-library). The library provides out-of-the-box support for common business forms:

- auto policy declaration pages
- balance sheets
- bank statements
- closing disclosures
- credit card statements
- driers licenses
- explanation of benefits
- loss runs
- pay stubs
- resumes
- tax forms
- ....and more

For a quickstart on extracting from these document types, see the [Quick extract](doc:excel) tutorial.
