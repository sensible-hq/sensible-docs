With Sensible's beta Zapier integration, you can transform data in PDFs and other documents into emails, databases, Google sheets, and other supported Zapier destinations.

For example, you can extract data in 1040 tax forms:

And send the data to spreadsheets, emails, databases, or other supported Zapier destinations. The following image shows how Zapier can add extracted data from each document as a record, or row, in an Airtable database:

When creating a Zapier integration, you can either:

- Run extractions and then act on the data with a **Sensible trigger**.
- Trigger extractions automatically outside of Sensible, then act on the data with a **Sensible action**.

Every time you run an extraction using the Sensible [app](https://app.sensible.so/quick-extraction) or [API](ref:choosing-an-endpoint), you can automatically send the data to a destination, for example an email or database, using a **Sensible trigger**:

You can bypass the Sensible app or API and instead trigger Sensible extractions with file actions in Google drive, email, or other supported Zapier apps. Then send the extraction to the destination of your choice with a **Sensible action**.
