Introduction
----

If you're trying to convert a document, such as a PDF, into an Excel file, you often find tools that copy the document's visual layout into a spreadsheet, with no meaningful relationship between the extracted text and the underlying cells. 

In contrast, Sensible converts document tables, checkboxes, paragraphs, and even complex repeating section layouts into meaningfully labeled column/row pairs and linked sheets. For a list of document file types that Sensible can extract data from, see [Supported file types](doc:file-types).

This topic describes the rules Sensible uses to:

- convert data extracted from one document, such as a PDF, into an Excel spreadsheet or CSV file.

- combine data extracted from multiple documents into one spreadsheet

Sensible extracts the data as JSON using a SenseML configuration, then applies the rules to create spreadsheet data such as tables, labeled columns, and linked sheets.

Prerequisites
----


To get a document's data into a spreadsheet, you must first:

- Configure extractions for a document type, either by authoring an extraction configuration using Sensible, or by using Sensible's [open-source configuration library](https://app.sensible.so/library) for common document types.   

- Run an extraction on a target document that's in your configured document type


CSV files
===

To generate CSV files, Sensible uses the same rules described in the following sections, except that Sensible uses blank rows instead of tabbed sheets to separate extraction content.

Multi-document spreadsheet
====

Sensible combines multiple document extractions into one spreadsheet when:

- You extract from a [portfolio](doc:portfolio) document.
- You input multiple extractions to the Generate Excel [method](doc:sdk-guides) or [endpoint](ref:get-excel-extraction).

To combine extractions, Sensible uses the same rules described in the following single-document spreadsheet rules. Sensible uses the following additional rules:

- For all sheets other than the `<fields>` sheet, Sensible creates a new sheet for each document, and prefixes each sheet name with a zero-indexed document number, for example `doc_0` or `doc_1`.

- For the `<fields>`sheet, Sensible appends data for each document in a new row. For each field ID, Sensible appends data under the same column if it finds a matching field ID from another extraction in your call to the Generate Excel method or endpoint, or under a new column if it doesn't find an matching field ID.

- For portfolio extractions, Sensible adds metadata to the `<fields>` sheet, for example, the page range of the document in the portfolio.

  

**Tips**

- To avoid manually merging the similarly named columns,  Sensible recommends using the same IDs for corresponding fields across different SenseML configs in a  document type.  For example, if document A outputs fields `car_model` and `car_year`, and document B outputs `car_model` and `manufacture_year`,  Sensible creates a spreadsheet like the following:

[block:html]
{
  "html": "<div><iframe class=\"spreadsheet\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRkj6u0ukgEr9VpHP19vuzohqtqJYJOOtzYzNGi3ZFJYJQ3hLVBowJDjbTcjeBahZoz9_rULfFO3Hu6/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false\"></iframe></div>\n\n<style>.spreadsheet{width:100%;}</style>"
}
[/block]  

â€‹        In the preceding example, Sensible recommends using either `car_year` or `manufacture_year`, not both.

- To configure multi-document spreadsheet output using different rules than those described here, configure rules with Sensible's [Zapier](doc:zapier) integration. You can map single-value field output with this integration, but not multi-value field output.



Single-document spreadsheet
====



**Overview**

Sensible transforms JSON data extracted from a single document  to a spreadsheet using the following rules:

- the `fields` sheet lists each piece of document data that can be represented as a single-cell value. For example, an extracted total monthly mortgage dollar amount.
- `<field_id>` sheets hold more complex pieces of document data. For example, an extracted table.
- `<field_id>.<index>` sheets hold complex repeating document data. For example, an extracted claims loss run.

For more information, see the following sections.

`fields` sheet
====

The `fields` sheet lists fields and their values as key-value dictionaries, with the field ID as the column heading and value as the row. Sensible outputs a field to this sheet if the field:

- outputs a single `value`. For example, the [Box](doc:box), [Label](doc:label), [Row](doc:row) and [Region](doc:region) methods each output a single value by default.

- outputs a predictably short array of values that can easily be stringified in a single cell. Typically this is the result of a [Type](doc:types) configuration, for example, the [Name](doc:types#name) type always outputs an array.

Example
-----

Sensible converts the JSON extraction output from the [auto_insurance_anyco](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/raw/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/auto_insurance_anyco.pdf) example described in the [Getting started with layout-based extractions](doc:getting-started) to the following spreadsheet:

**Spreadsheet output**



[block:html]
{
  "html": "<div><iframe class=\"spreadsheet\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRJO_nwPRVe84ZdAi-gc6mny0zhRO9iz4nclfEKSBFQWHotARcgUkwfcinpGJTzPM4GIoIvf6PcN7zv/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false\"></iframe></div>\n\n<style>.spreadsheet{width:100%;}</style>"
}

**Example document**

The preceding spreadsheet contains data from the following example document:

| Example document | [Download link](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/raw/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/auto_insurance_anyco.pdf) |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

**Example configuration**

See the [Getting started with layout-based extractions](doc:getting-started)  for the SenseML configuration for this example.

**JSON output**

The following JSON document extraction output is the source for this spreadsheet:

  ```json
  {
    "policy_period": {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "April 14, 2021 - Oct 14, 2021"
    },
    "comprehensive_premium": {
      "source": "$150",
      "value": 150,
      "unit": "$",
      "type": "currency"
    },
    "property_liability_premium": {
      "source": "$10",
      "value": 10,
      "unit": "$",
      "type": "currency"
    },
    "policy_number": {
      "value": "123456789",
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
  ```



`<field_id>` sheets
====

Each  `<field_id>` sheet lists the output of a single field. Sensible outputs a field to this sheet if the field outputs multiple values. For example: 

- the [table methods](doc:table-methods) and other methods that output nested JSON objects.
- methods that output arrays of unpredictable length, for example, fields with `"match":"all"` configured.

Example
-----

Sensible converts the example JSON output from the [example document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/fixed_table.pdf) described in the [Fixed Table](doc:fixed-table#examples) method to the following spreadsheet:



[block:html]
{
  "html": "<div><iframe class=\"spreadsheet\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRU-wjC2m6F0ACgU1Ry_W1zggeb7-oM_tZZ7XAsadz8m7uzZos1TY7B0XLpGW79_7rgltqpj8eCB262/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false\"></iframe></div>\n\n<style>.spreadsheet{width:100%;}</style>"
}
[/block]



The preceding example shows that the `fields` sheet lists the corresponding sheets for fields that have complex output.  In this case, you must click on the `agile_risks_table_updates_monthly` sheet to view the table output.
