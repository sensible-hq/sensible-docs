Let's get started with the Sensible API! We'll use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to get a quick sense of how the endpoints work together. 

 Try the extraction endpoint
 ====

Let's try out the most commonly used endpoint, the  [/extract endpoint](https://sensiblehq.readme.io/reference#rate-confirmations). This endpoint takes a PDF file and returns extracted data synchronously. 



**Prerequisite: Create a config**

1. You need an example config. If you haven't already done so, follow the steps in [Create a config](doc:quickstart#section-create-the-config) to create an example `auto_insurance_quote` config. 
2. **Important!** Remember to click **Publish** in the Sensible app to publish your config, or this request won't work:

**download postman**

For an easy way to run this cURL request, download the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) desktop app. 



**import the request**

1. Copy this code sample, and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key:

```curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sensible.so/v0/extract/auto_insurance_quote \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/pdf' \
  --data-binary '@/PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_PDF/auto_insurance_anyco_golden.pdf'
```



2. In the Postman desktop app, click **Import**, select **Raw text**, and paste in the code sample:

2. Download the following example PDF, which works with the example `auto_insurance_quote` config you created previously:

   

3. Correct the path to your downloaded PDF:

- **If you're in the command line:** Replace `PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_PDF` with the local directory path to the PDF.
- **If you're in Postman:** In the request, click the **Body** tab, select **binary**, then click **Select file** and select your PDF:

â€‹    

7. Click **Send**, and you should see a response like this:

```json
{
    "id": "b0ac180d-55d2-4946-80c0-a87243319746",
    "created": "2021-05-20T18:02:37.019Z",
    "status": "COMPLETE",
    "type": "auto_insurance_quote",
    "parsed_document": {
        "policy_number": {
            "type": "string",
            "value": "123456789"
        },
        "policy_period": {
            "type": "string",
            "value": " April 14, 2021 - Oct 14, 2021"
        },
        "comprehensive_premium": {
            "source": "$150",
            "value": 150,
            "unit": "$",
            "type": "currency"
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** You don't have to specify the config you created (`anyco`) in this call. Sensible looks at all the configs for the document type you made in this quickstart (`auto_insurance_quote`), and **automatically** chooses the one that fits best!
