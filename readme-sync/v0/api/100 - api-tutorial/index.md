Let's get started with the Sensible API! We'll use Postman to get a quick sense of how the endpoints work together. 

Prerequisites
====



To follow this tutorial, you'll need:

- an example config
-  [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) desktop app (or follow along with cURL in the command line)

**Prerequisite: Create an example config**

1. You need an example config and doc type. If you haven't already done so, follow the steps in [Create a config](doc:quickstart#section-create-the-config) to create an example `anyco` config in an example  `auto_insurance_quote` document type. 
2. **Important!** Remember to click **Publish** in the Sensible app to publish your config, or your requests won't work:

**Prerequisite: Download Postman**

For an easy way to run the cURL requests, download the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) desktop app.
