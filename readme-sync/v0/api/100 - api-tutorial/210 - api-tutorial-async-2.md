title: "Try asynchronous extraction from a Sensible URL"
hidden: false
---

PDFs that are greater than 4.5MB in size or that require over 30 seconds of processing time must use Sensible's asynchronous endpoints. You have two options for asynchronously processing your PDF:

- Extracting from a PDF at a URL you provide. This is a good option if you host your PDFs at either publicly accessible or a pre-signed URLs. The URL must respond to GET requests with PDF bytes. 
- Extracting from a PDF at a Sensible-provided URL. This is a good option if you can't easily create either publicly accessible or pre-signed URLs for your PDFs.

This topic covers the second option. 

For either option, you can specify a [webhook](doc:api-tutorial-webhook) for Sensible to push the results to as soon as they're ready.

Extract from a URL Sensible provides
====

Prerequisites
----

This tutorial assumes you've completed the [prerequisites](doc:api-tutorial#section-prerequisites).


Generate the upload URL
----


Generate a one-time Sensible URL for the document extraction you want to run (this URL expires within minutes). 

  1. Copy the following code sample and replace YOUR_API_KEY:

```json
curl --request POST 'https://api.sensible.so/v0/generate_upload_url/auto_insurance_quote' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

2. Import the code sample into Postman and click **Send**:

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/api_quickstart_postman_3.png)

You should see a response like the following:

```json
{
    "id": "28c7e5ac-3943-4f86-bd72-8aac3fa38a43",
    "created": "2021-06-16T16:22:56.576Z",
    "status": "WAITING",
    "type": "auto_insurance_quote",
    "upload_url": "https://sensible-so-utility-bucket-prod-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/EXTRACTION_UPLOAD/sensible/fc3484c5-3f35-4129-bb29-0ad1291ee9f8/EXTRACTION/28c7e5ac-3943-4f86-bd72-8aac3fa38a43.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=REDACTED&Expires=1623861476&Signature=REDACTED&x-amz-security-token=REDACTED"
}
```

Extract the data 
----


Now use the one-time URL you just generated to extract data from the document:

1. Copy the following code sample. Replace the URL with the `upload_url` that you got as a response in the previous step:

```json
curl --request PUT 'YOUR_UPLOAD_URL' \
--data-binary '@/PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_PDF/auto_insurance_anyco_golden.pdf'
```

2. Import the code sample into Postman:

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/api_quickstart_postman_4.png)

3. If you haven't already done so, download the following example PDF, which works with the example `auto_insurance_quote` config you created previously in the **Prerequisites** section:

| auto_insurance_anyco_golden | [Download link](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/raw/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/auto_insurance_anyco_golden.pdf) |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

4. Correct the path to your downloaded PDF in your request: click the **Body** tab, select **binary**, then click **Select file** and select your PDF:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/quickstart_postman_1.png)

5. Correct headers automatically generated by Postman: in the **Headers** tab, click the eye icon to display hidden headers:

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/api_quickstart_postman_headers_1.png)

6. Disable all `Content-Type` headers (you might see `Content-Type: application/pdf` and `Content-Type: text/plain` ):

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/api_quickstart_postman_headers_2.png)

   If you don't disable these headers, you might see an error response when you send the response, for example, `SignatureDoesNotMatch`.

7. Click **Send** to send the request. You should see an empty 200 response:

Retrieve extraction
----

 To retrieve the extraction results for the sample PDF, you have two options:

- Use the `/documents` endpoint. See the following steps.
- Use a webhook. See [Try a webhook](doc:api-tutorial-webhook).


To retrieve the extraction results with the  `/documents` endpoint, take the following steps:


1. In a previous step on this page, you got back a result that included information like this:

   ```json
   {
       "id": "14d82783-c12b-4e70-b0ae-ca1ce35a9836",
       "created": "2021-06-16T16:22:56.576Z",
       "status": "WAITING",
   ```

2. Copy the document extraction `id` from that response. You'll use it to download the PDF extraction.

3. Copy the following code sample and replace YOUR_EXTRACTION_ID and YOUR_API_KEY:

```json
curl --request GET 'https://api.sensible.so/v0/documents/YOUR_EXTRACTION_ID' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

3. In the Postman desktop app, click **Import**, select **Raw text**, and paste in the code sample:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/api_quickstart_postman_2.png)

4. Click **Send**. You should see a response like the following:

```json
{
    "id": "14d82783-c12b-4e70-b0ae-ca1ce35a9836",
    "created": "2021-06-15T16:44:18.917Z",

        },
        "policy_number": {
            "type": "string",
            "value": "123456789"
        }
    },
    "download_url": "https://sensible-so-document-type-bucket-prod-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sensible/fc3484c5-3f35-4129-bb29-0ad1291ee9f8/EXTRACTION/14d82783-c12b-4e70-b0ae-ca1ce35a9836.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAR355P7ASRMWOLX6W&Expires=1623790786&Signature=REDACTED-amz-security-token=REDACTED"
}
```
