Get started with extracting structured data from documents using the Sensible API.

If you're new to APIs in general, these tutorials are a good starting point.

Or, if you're familiar with APIs:

- see the [API quickstart](doc:quickstart) to get a sample API response.

- explore the Sensible Postman collection:

To follow these tutorials, you need:

- An [API key](https://app.sensible.so/account). Create this key after you sign up for a [Sensible account](https://app.sensible.so/register). 
-  [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) desktop app, or a command line with cURL installed.
-  An example extraction configuration. See the following section.

**Prerequisite: Create example extraction configuration**

1. Navigate to Sensible's [open-source configuration library](https://app.sensible.so/library/) to choose an example document type. For this tutorial, select **Tax forms**.

2. Select **Clone to account** to copy example tax forms and associated configurations for extracting data from those forms to your account.
