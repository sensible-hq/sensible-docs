If you want to extract from any of the following document types, you can get started in minutes using the [Sensible configuration library](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-configuration-library). The library provides out-of-the-box support for common business forms:

- auto policy declaration pages
- balance sheet
- bank statements
- closing disclosure
- credit card statements
- drivers license
- explanation of benefit
- health insurance claims
- home policy declaration pages
- loss runs
- pay stubs
- pet policy declaration pages
- resumes
- tax forms
- verifications of employment
- rent rolls
- offering memorandums
- ....and more

To add supported document types to your Sensible account:

1. Click the **Configuration library** tab, and browse or search for your document type. Click **group** to view document types by industry:
