Use fallback configs to capture long-tail document variations in a document type. For example, if you have several high-volume providers of a document type, you can capture them with a few dedicated layout-based configs.  Use a generalized LLM-based config to capture the long tail of smaller providers. 

For an example implementation, see [How to capture the long tail when extracting data from paystubs](https://www.sensible.so/blog/paystubs-long-tail).
