If you want to extract from any of the following document types, you can get started in minutes using the [Sensible configuration library](https://github.com/sensible-hq/sensible-configuration-library). The library provides out-of-the-box support for common business forms:

- auto policy declaration pages
- balance sheet
- bank statements
- closing disclosure
- credit card statements
- drivers license
- explanation of benefit
- loss runs
- pay stubs
- resumes
- tax forms
- ....and more

To add supported document types to your Sensible account:

1. Click the **Configuration library** tab, and search for your document type:

2. Click your document type. Sensible displays the specific forms it supports in the document type.
3. Click **Clone to account**. Sensible displays the cloned document type and its form-specific configs in the **Document types** tab.
