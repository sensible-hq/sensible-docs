TODO: describe how these relate to LLM portfolio extractions

Good description can describe a typical first page of a doc-type, last page of a doc-type and commonly found fields/values.

Example of document descriptions:

- `To accurately classify this type of document look at the bottom left of each page of the document and if you see ACORD 131 then it is an instance of an Acord 131 form.`
- `This type of document is a scanned bank check. Usually only a single page.`
- `This type of document is a scanned envelope that is stamped. Can be 1 - 2 pages long. If the page after an envelope image is empty and there is not information other than the header and footer, then please include that page in the envelope document as well.`
- `This type of document is an insurance policy. Each policy usually contains a distinct policy number` . 
- `This type of document is an invoice. Each invoice usually lists balance and payments.`
- `This type of document is a car rental agreement. Note that each car rental agreement can include images of the reservation confirmation, bank account screenshots and drivers license. The first page of each document includes a rental-agreement/reservation number.`
