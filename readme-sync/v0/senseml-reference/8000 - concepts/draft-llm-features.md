Sensible supports large language model (LLM)-based document automation workflows. In particular, Sensible supports:

- document data extraction, within the document types you define in your Sensible account. For more information, see LLM-based methods TODO link.
- classification of documents by the document types you define in your Sensible account. Fore more information, see Classifying documents by type TODO link.

#### document extraction features

Here are some of the the things you can do w/ document data extraction:

- Extract document primitives like tables, lists, and short facts. TODO: short little image of a doc showing these things??  TODO add those same images to the LLM-based methods index page?
- Extract multimodal stuff (TODO copy from \author)
- Chained-prompts (TODO)
- Search by summary for TODO WHY?
- configurable LLM engine; choose from Anthropic or OpenAI. (that's it right?) for TODO WHY?
- confidence signals for qualify LLM accuracy (TODO link)
- advance configuration for stuff like:
  - context completness
  - context location
  - troubleshoot prompts

#### document classification features

Here are some of the things you can do with document classification:

- classify any document that belongs to one of the types you've defined in your account. you can configure LLM classification w/ a document type description, or leave it as-is
- Segment a portfolio document into multiple document types coplete w page ranges and then treat each document in the protfiol separately.
