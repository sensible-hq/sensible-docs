## Notes

- When extracting from image file formats, Sensible ignores OCR or OCR preprocessor settings you configure in the document type or SenseML configuration. For more information about OCR, see [OCR level](doc:ocr-level).
- For DOC and DOCX documents, Sensible converts the document to PDF before processing it.
- For XLSX documents, Sensible converts the document to PDF. To style the document, Sensible:
     - Discards truncated text in cells. To retain the text, reformat or resize the cells in Excel so the text is visible.
     - Converts sheets to pages by scaling text so that all sheets have the same width and by breaking long sheets into consecutive pages.
     - Adds the sheet name as a header on each page.
- For TIFF documents, SenseML methods that attempt to render pages return an error, including:
     - pixel-based methods, such as Box, Checkbox, Signature, and image coordinates returned by the Document Range method
     - Key/Value method
     - Fixed Table method with the Stop parameter specified. Use the Text Table method as an alternative.
