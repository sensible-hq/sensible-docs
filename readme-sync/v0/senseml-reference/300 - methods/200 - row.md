title: "Row"
hidden: false
---
Matches all lines to the left or right of the anchor line. 

 A "row" is defined as lines of text distributed along a horizontal line. Each matching line in the "row" must have a top boundary that is within  0.08 inches of the anchor's top boundary.  For example, the following image shows a red line that defines the alignment for a row of bold text:

Parameters

| key               | value                                        | description                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id (**required**) | `row`                                        |                                                              |
| includeAnchor     | boolean. default: `false`                    | Includes the anchor line in the method output                |
| position          | `right`, `left`. default: `right`            | Matches to the left or right                                 |
| tiebreaker        | `first`, `second`, `third`, `last`, `>`, `<` | Which line in the row is the target. Use the comparisons `>` and `<` to extract maximum and minimum values in the row. Lines are [sorted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#relational_operators) alphanumerically using unicode values. If you want to compare numeric amounts and ignore non-numbers in the row,  then add a number [type](doc:types) such as  `type: currency` as a top-level parameter to the field. |



Examples
====

The following example shows the Row method.

**Config**

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "number_1_language_on_github",
      "anchor": {
        "match": [
          {
            "text": "most popular on github",
            "type": "includes"
          },
          {
            "text": "first",
            "type": "startsWith"
          }
        ]
      },
      "method": {
        "id": "row",
        "position": "left",
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "python_change_in_TIBOE_rating",
      "type": "percentage",
      "anchor": {
        "match": [
          {
            "text": "popular in search engines",
            "type": "includes"
          },
          {
            "text": "Python",
            "type": "startsWith"
          }
        ]
      },
      "method": {
        "id": "row",
        "tiebreaker": "second"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Output**

```json
{
  "number_1_language_on_github": {
    "value": "Javascript",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "python_change_in_TIBOE_rating": {
    "source": "2.75%",
    "value": 2.75,
    "type": "percentage"
  }
}
```

**Notes**

The preceding example demonstrates extracting data from two consecutive tables:

1. The first field has an anchor with two matches to avoid duplicate text in the second table. First the anchor matches the text `most popular on github`, then it anchors on the text  `first`  in a row. The method then extracts the top-ranked Github language name to the left of the anchor match. 
2. The second field also has an anchor with two matches. It anchors on the row containing `Python`, then extracts the second percentage in the row to the right of the anchor.

Notes

To extract an entire table, see the [Table method](doc:table).  To extract a column, see the [Column method](doc:column).
