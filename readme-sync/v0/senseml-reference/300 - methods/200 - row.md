title: "Row"
hidden: false
---
Matches all lines to the left or right of the anchor line. 

 A "row" is defined as lines of text distributed along an x-axis. Each matching line in the "row" must have a  top boundary that is within  0.08 inches of the anchor's top boundary.  For example, the following image shows a red line that defines the alignment for a row of bold text:

Examples

The following example shows the Row method:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "number_1_language_on_github",
      "anchor": {
        "match": [
          {
            "text": "most popular on github",
            "type": "includes"
          },
          {
            "text": "first",
            "type": "startsWith"
          }
        ]
      },
      "method": {
        "id": "row",
        "tiebreaker": "first",
        "position": "left",
        "includeAnchor": true
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "python_change_in_TIBOE_rating",
      "type": "percentage",
      "anchor": {
        "match": [
          {
            "text": "popular in search engines",
            "type": "includes"
          },
          {
            "text": "Python",
            "type": "startsWith"
          }
        ]
      },
      "method": {
        "id": "row",
        "tiebreaker": "second"
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

The following image shows how the Sensible app represents this config in an example PDF:

![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/row_example.png)

And the output is:

```json
{
  "number_1_language_on_github": {
    "value": "Javascript",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "python_change_in_TIBOE_rating": {
    "source": "2.75%",
    "value": 2.75,
    "type": "percentage"
  }
}
```

The preceding example demonstrates choosing data from two consecutive tables:

1. The first field has an anchor with two matches: first the anchor matches the heading `Languages by Github rank`  to ensure we are in the first table, and then it matches on the text  `first`  to find the row with the top-ranked Github language. The method then grabs the language name to the left of the last anchor match (`first`). 
2. The second field also has an anchor with two matches: first the anchor matches  the heading `Languages ranked by search engine` to ensure we are in the second table, and then it finds the word `Python` to find the first row with that language.  The method then grabs the % change in ranking for Python by taking the second item in the row to the right of the last anchor match (`Python`).






Parameters
====


| key               | value                                        | description                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id (**required**) | `row`                                        |                                                              |
| includeAnchor     | boolean. default: `false`                    | Includes the anchor line in the method output                |
| position          | `right`, `left`. default: `right`            | Matches to the left or right                                 |
| tiebreaker        | `first`, `second`, `third`, `last`, `>`, `<` | Which line in the row is the target. Use the comparisons `>` and `<` to grab maximum and minimum values in the row. By default the comparisons are sorted alphanumerically using [unicode values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Less_than).  If you want to compare numeric amounts and ignore non-numbers in the row,  then add `type: number` or `type: currency` as a top-level parameter to the field. |
