title: "Summarizer"
hidden: true
---
Automatically extracts key/value pairs from short snippets of free text using [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) machine learning (ML). The Summarizer compute field method takes a snippet of text extracted using the [Topic](doc:topic) method as input, and extracts key/value pairs informed by a few short samples of extracted values. 

Parameters
====

The following parameters are contained in the computed field's [global Method](doc:computed-field-methods#parameters) parameter: 


| key                      | value        | description                                                  |
| :----------------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| id (**required**)        | `summarizer` |                                                              |
| source_id (**required**) | field ID     | Specifies a field that uses a [Topic](doc:topic) method, and whose output which contains the relevant snippet of text containing the key/value information you want to extract. |
| fields                   | string array | Names of the keys you want to extract. These names have an impact on the free-text extraction, so choose names that have a meaningful semantic relationship to the target data to extract. For example, for a dollar amount of rent to extract,  `rent`, `rents`, and `rent_in_dollars` are all good naming choices. |
| samples                  | object       | Short snippets of text containing examples of how to extract information. Contains these parameters:<br/>`prompt`: a string up to XX characters long with a free text example containing the information you want to extract.<br/>`values` The target information to extract from the prompt, generally a single word or number. List the values in the same order as you listed corresponding fields in the Fields parameter.<br/>If Sensible can't find the target information in the Source ID parameter, then the term can't be found, the method returns the value found in the prompt(?) |

The following example shows using the Summarizer method to extract the monthly rent and the payment frequency.
