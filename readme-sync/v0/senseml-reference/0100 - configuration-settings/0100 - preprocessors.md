- `ligature`
    - Intelligently replaces Unicode ligatures in PDF text extraction
    - `mappings`
        - An object mapping strings (e.g., `"\u0000"`) to an array of possible ligature replacements (e.g., `["ff", "ffi", "fi", "fl"]`)
        - `ligature` will replace each instance of the string with the first replacement that has a dictionary match. If `ligature` finds no dictionary match, it will not modify the extracted text
- `mergeLines`
    - Merges nearby lines more aggressively than the built-in line merger
    - `directlyAdjacentThreshold`
        - Fraction of line height under which two adjacent lines are merged without a space. For example, at 0.15 two lines will be merged without a space in between their contents when they are less than 15% of the line height apart from one another
    - `adjacentThreshold`
        - Identical to the above, but for mergers with a space in between
- `pageFilter`
    - Filters out low-scoring pages given a bag of target terms and stop terms
    - `terms`
        - An array of strings with terms to score positively (e.g., `["number of buildings", "no. of buildings"]`)
    - `stopTerms` (optional)
        - An array of strings with terms to score negatively (e.g., `["comparables"]`)
    - `maxPages`
        - The maximum number of highest-scoring pages to pass through the filter
    - `pageFilter` removes all text from the pages that do not pass the filter
- `pageRange`
    - Filters pages outside the start page and end page
    - `startPage` (optional, defaults to 0)
        - Zero-based index of the first page to pass through the filter (inclusive)
    - `endPage` (optional, defaults to length of pages array)
        - Zero-based index of the last page to pass through the filter (exclusive)
- `removeHeader`
    - Removes repeated elements at the start of pages in the document
    - `startsOnPage` (optional, page number not index, defaults to 1)
        - The first page on which to start checking for repeated elements
- `removeFooter`
    - Removes repeated elements at the end of pages in the document
    - `startsOnPage` (optional, page number not index, defaults to 1)
        - The first page on which to start checking for repeated elements
