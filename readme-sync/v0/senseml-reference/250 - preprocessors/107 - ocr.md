title: "OCR"

Use this preprocessor to selectively OCR pages. This preprocessor is useful when a PDF has some pages that contain embedded text, and other pages that contain images of text or handwriting. The pages containing images of text could include scanned pages inserted into an otherwise digitally generated PDF, or handwritten text that was digitally drawn into a PDF form. Selectively OCRing only the pages containing text images, rather than the entire document, improves performance. 

If the whole document is a scan, you don't need to configure this preprocessor. Instead, Sensible automatically OCRs the whole document.

Parameters
====

| key                       | value        | description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type` (**required**)     | `ocr`        |                                                              |
| match (**required**)      | Match object | The text relative to which you define the single page number to OCR.  For example, if you know that the page after the heading "Policy Addendums" is always a scanned image, then you'd specify: <br>      "type": "ocr",<br/>      "match": "policy addendums",<br/>      "pageOffset": 1<br/> To OCR a single page offset from the first page of the document, rather than offset to matched text, specify `"match": { "type": "first" }`. |
| pageOffset (**required**) | number       | The zero-indexed number of the single page to OCR            |

Examples
====

The following config specifies to apply OCR processing:

- to the first page of the document (`"pageOffset": 0`)
- to the fourth page of the document (`"pageOffset": 3`)
- to whichever page the text "additional riders" occurs on (`"match": "additional riders"`)

The config then outputs all lines of the document (`"id": "all_lines_in_doc"`), to double check that OCR correctly extracted the text on those pages.
