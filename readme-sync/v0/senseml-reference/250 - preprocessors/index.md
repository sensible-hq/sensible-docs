title: "Preprocessors"

The following pages describe preprocessors you can use to clean up your documents before extracting structured data:

* [Ligature](doc:ligature)
* [Merge Lines](doc:merge-lines)
* [Page Filter](doc:page-filter)
* [Page Range](doc:page-range)
* [Remove Header](doc:remove-header)
* [Remove Footer](doc:remove-footer)



Preprocessors execute in the order you define them in an array. For example, define a Page Range preprocessor first in the array, then a Merge Lines preprocessor, to avoid merging lines on pages you want to ignore.
