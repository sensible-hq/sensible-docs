title: "Merge lines"
hidden: false

Merges nearby lines more aggressively than the built-in line merger. Use this preprocessor when the PDF contains oversplit lines, lines overlapping on the x-axis, or "jittery" lines misaligned on the y-axis.

Parameters
----

| key                                        | value                                  | description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type` (**required**)                      | string                                 | "mergeLines"                                                 |
| `directlyAdjacentThreshold` (**required**) | number >= 0.16  default: 0.16          | Fraction of line height under which two adjacent lines (i.e., horizontally distributed along an x-axis) are merged without a space. For example, at 0.15 two lines are merged without a space in between their contents when they are less than 15% of the line height apart from one another.<br/>Under the hood, Sensible uses the default setting for this parameter to transform separate tokens output from OCR into lines. It's relatively uncommon to need to adjust the default value for this parameter. |
| `adjacentThreshold` (**required**)         | number >= 0.6 default:  0.6            | Fraction of line height under which two adjacent lines (i.e., horizontally distributed along an x-axis) are merged with a space.<br> Use this parameter to correct oversplit lines. For an example, see the Examples section. |
| `yOverlapThreshold`                        | number between 0 and 1.0. default: 1.0 | Configure this parameter if lines are not perfectly aligned at the same height on the page. The Y Overlap Threshold is the y overlap above which the Merge Lines preprocessor merges two adjacent lines. Y overlap is the portion of the joint y-axis range of two lines that is occupied by both lines. For example, if two lines share the same minimum and maximum y-axis values, they will have an overlap of 1. If one line's extent is from 0 to 10 and the other lineâ€™s extent is from 2 to 12 on the y-axis, they will have an overlap of .667 (8 / 12).   For an example, see the Examples section. |
| `minXGapThreshold`                         | number in inches                       | The amount of overlap in inches on the x-axis above/below which two lines that overlap on an x-axis are merged into one line. |

Examples
====

Oversplit lines
----

The following image shows a PDF that has oversplit lines. For example, the phrase "premium driver discount" is split into three lines even though to the human eye it reads as one line:

The following image shows using the Merge Lines preprocessor to fix the oversplit lines and find a discount amount for a specific vehicle:

This example uses the following config:

```json
{
  "preprocessors": [
    {
      "type": "mergeLines",
      "directlyAdjacentThreshold": 0.16,
      "adjacentThreshold": 1
    }
  ],
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "premier_driver_discount",
      "method": {
        "id": "row"
      },
      "anchor": {
        "match": {
          "type": "includes",
          "text": "premier driver"
        },
        "end": {
          "type": "includes",
          "text": "vehicle 06"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Jittery lines on a y-axis
----

The following image shows using the Y Overlap parameter to ignore "jitter" on the y-axis, where two lines that should be perfectly aligned are not  (for example, as the result of a low-quality scan).

You can try out this example yourself in the Sensible app using the following downloadable PDF and config:

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

This example uses the following config:

```json
{
  "preprocessors": [
    {
      "type": "mergeLines",
      "directlyAdjacentThreshold": 0.16,
      "adjacentThreshold": 1.3,
      "yOverlapThreshold": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "merged_line",
      "method": {
        "id": "label",
        "position": "right",
        "includeAnchor": true
      },
      "anchor": "these two"
    }
  ]
}
```
Overlapping lines on an x-axis
----

The following image shows using the Min X Gap Threshold parameter to correctly extract overlapping text in a poorly formatted PDF:

```
{
  "preprocessors": [

      "type": "mergeLines",
      "directlyAdjacentThreshold": 0.16,
      "adjacentThreshold": 0.6,
      "minXGapThreshold": 0
    }
  ],
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "field_1",
      "method": {
        "id": "label",
        "includeAnchor": true,
