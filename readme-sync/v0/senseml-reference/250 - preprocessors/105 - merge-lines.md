title: "Merge lines"
hidden: false
---

Merges nearby lines more aggressively than the built-in line merger. This preprocessor solves line-recognition problems caused poor-quality PDF scans, handwritten text, and other PDF formatting. This preprocessor solves:

- oversplit lines
- lines overlapping on the x-axis
- "jittery" lines misaligned on the y-axis

 There are limitations to the combinations of parameter values you can set. For more information, see the Notes section.

Parameters
====

| key                                        | value                                  | description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type` (**required**)                      | `mergeLines`                           |                                                              |
| `directlyAdjacentThreshold` (**required**) | number >= 0.16                         | Usually, it's recommended to leave the default for this parameter (0.16).<br/>Specifies the fraction of line height under which two adjacent lines (i.e., horizontally distributed along an x-axis) are merged without a space.  For example, at 0.16 two lines are merged without a space in between their contents when they are less than 16% of the line height apart from one another. The built-in merger uses 0.16, so choosing a larger number merges more aggressively. <br/>Under the hood, Sensible uses the default setting for this parameter to transform separate tokens output from OCR into lines. |
| `adjacentThreshold` (**required**)         | number >= 0.6                          | Corrects oversplit lines. <br/>Specifies the fraction of line height under which two adjacent lines (i.e., horizontally distributed along an x-axis) are merged with a space. The built-in merger uses 0.6, so choosing a larger number merges more aggressively.<br> For an example, see the Examples section. |
| `yOverlapThreshold`                        | number between 0 and 1.0. default: 1.0 | Corrects lines that are not perfectly aligned at the same height on the page. <br/> Specifies the y overlap above which the Merge Lines preprocessor merges two adjacent lines. Y overlap is the portion of the joint y-axis range of two lines that is occupied by both lines. For example, if two lines share the same minimum and maximum y-axis values, they will have an overlap of 1. If one line's extent is from 0 to 10 and the other lineâ€™s extent is from 2 to 12 on the y-axis, they will have an overlap of .667 (8 / 12). <br/>For an example, see the Examples section. |
| `minXGapThreshold`                         | number in inches                       | Configure this parameter if two lines overlap on an x-axis. The default behavior is to merge these overlapping lines into two lines. If you want to split them instead, set a cap on the amount of overlap you want to allow. For example:<br/>0 means to split lines if there is no gap between them and their line boundaries are touching but not overlapping.<br/>0.1 means to split the lines if their boundaries overlap just a little bit, up to 0.1 inches.<br/>2.0 means to split the lines including when they overlap a lot, up to 2.0 inches.<br/>For an example, see the Examples section. |

Examples

Handwriting OCR 
----

Sensible uses OCR to recognize handwriting. Since handwritten text is a lot messier than typed text, the Merge Lines processor can help you clean up output. This is particularly useful for output from Google OCR, which by default groups detected text into words rather than lines.

The following image shows using a Merge Line preprocessor to clean up faked handwritten data. The OCR engine used is Google OCR:

Without the preprocessor, the lines are oversplit:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/merge_lines_ocr_example_2.png)

You can try out this example yourself in the Sensible app using the following downloadable PDF and config. 



| Example PDF for OCR Merge Lines | [Download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/merge_lines_ocr_example.pdf) |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

To duplicate this example, remember to click **Edit Settings**  for the Document Type and set Google OCR: 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/merge_lines_ocr_example_1.png)

This example uses the following config:

```json
{
  "preprocessors": [
    {
      "type": "mergeLines",
      "directlyAdjacentThreshold": 0.15,
      "adjacentThreshold": 0.8,
      "yOverlapThreshold": 0.8,
      "minXGapThreshold": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "all_lines_in_doc",
      "method": {
        "id": "documentRange",
        "includeAnchor": true
      },
      "anchor": {
        "match": {
          "type": "first"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Try modifying this config to observe the effects of the different parameters. For example:

- set `"adjacentThreshold": 0.1` to see oversplit lines. 
- set `"adjacentThreshold": 2.0` to see very aggressively merged lines. 
- revert Adjacent Threshold to the original setting, then set `"yOverlapThreshold": 0.2`  to observe how text that is misaligned in terms of height (like the email address) merges more aggressively.


Oversplit lines
----

The following image shows a PDF that has oversplit lines. For example, the phrase "premium driver discount" is split into three lines even though the human eye reads it as one line:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/merge_lines_example_oversplit_1.png)

The following image shows using the Merge Lines preprocessor to fix the oversplit lines and find a discount amount for a specific vehicle:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/merge_lines_example_oversplit_2.png)

This example uses the following config:

```json
{
  "preprocessors": [
    {
      "type": "mergeLines",
      "directlyAdjacentThreshold": 0.16,
      "adjacentThreshold": 1
    }
  ],
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "premier_driver_discount",
      "method": {
        "id": "row"
      },
      "anchor": {
        "match": {
          "type": "includes",
          "text": "premier driver"
        },
        "end": {
          "type": "includes",
          "text": "vehicle 06"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Jittery lines on a y-axis
----

The following image shows using the Y Overlap parameter to ignore vertical misalignment or "jitter" in lines (for example, as the result of a low-quality scan or because of handwriting).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/merge_lines_example_yoverlap.png)


You can try out this example yourself in the Sensible app using the following downloadable PDF and config:

| Example PDF for Y Overlap | [Download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/merge_lines_yoverlap_example.pdf) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

This example uses the following config:

```json
{
  "preprocessors": [
    {
      "type": "mergeLines",
      "directlyAdjacentThreshold": 0.16,
      "adjacentThreshold": 1.3,
      "yOverlapThreshold": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "merged_line",
      "method": {
        "id": "label",
        "position": "right",
        "includeAnchor": true
      },
      "anchor": "these two"
    }
  ]
}
```
Overlapping lines on an x-axis
----

The following image shows using the Min X Gap Threshold parameter to correctly extract overlapping text in a poorly formatted PDF. In this example, the built-in behavior without a Min X Gap Threshold is to merge the overlapping lines into one line (`Supplementary underinsured/uninsured motorist coverage500,000 USD Combined single limit incl. umbl`). 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/merge_lines_minxgap_example.png)

But since the overlapping lines are part of a two-column table, it's better to split them into two lines using the Min X Gap Threshold parameter. That way, you can use the Row method on the lines, as in the preceding image.

You can try out this example yourself in the Sensible app using the following downloadable PDF and config:

| Example PDF for Min X Gap Threshold | [Download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/merge_lines_minxgap_example.pdf) |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

This example uses the following config:

```json
{
  "preprocessors": [
    {
      "type": "mergeLines",
      "directlyAdjacentThreshold": 0.16,
      "adjacentThreshold": 0.6,
      "minXGapThreshold": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "underinsured_limit",
      "method": {
        "id": "row"
      },
      "anchor": "supplementary",
  
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes
====
Because the Merge Lines preprocessor evaluates after the built-in line merger, there are limitations to the combinations of parameter values you can set. See the following for constraints:

**yOverlapThreshold** 

In general, when you set `"yOverlapThreshold"` to 1 or leave it unspecified, then mainly you modify `"adjacentThreshold"` by setting it to greater than 0.6.

In this situation,  `"directlyAdjacentThreshold"` and `"adjacentThreshold"` have no effect if both their values are less than 0.6. In other words, the following configuration has **no** effect:

```json
    {
      "type": "mergeLines",
      "directlyAdjacentThreshold": 0.5,
      "adjacentThreshold": 0.5,
     "yOverlapThreshold": 1,

    }

```
