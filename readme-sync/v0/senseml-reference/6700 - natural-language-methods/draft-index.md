Use natural-language SenseML methods to extract free text from unstructured documents, or as low-code alternatives to [layout based methods](doc:methods). For example, extract information from legal paragraphs in contracts and leases, or results from research papers. 

SenseML natural-language methods are powered by machine learning and natural language processing models, for example by the large language model [GPT-3](https://openai.com/api/).

The following topics describe natural language methods:

| Method                                                       | Example query (TODO: this should be visual editor + maybe output or SenseML) | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **[List]TODO**                                               | ![Click to enlarge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/images/final/box_1099.png) | Extracts a list of entities out of a document, where you don't know how they're represented |
| [NLP Table](doc:nlp-table) method                            |                                                              | Extracts a list of entities out of a document, where you know they're in a table |
| [Question](doc:question) method                              |                                                              | Extracts a single fact or data point                         |
| [Summarizer](doc:summarizer) computed field method + [Topic](doc:topic) method |                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |
