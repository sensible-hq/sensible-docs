Use natural-language SenseML methods to extract free text from unstructured documents. For example, extract information from legal paragraphs in contracts and leases, or results from research papers. 

SenseML natural-language methods are powered by machine learning and natural language processing models, for example by the large language model [GPT-3](https://openai.com/api/).

The following topics describe natural language methods:
