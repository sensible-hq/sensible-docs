Fine-tune natural-language methods with global parameters that apply to all NLP methods. **TODO question for reviewer -- would this also apply to Summarizer and Topic, or only the ones in Sensible Instruct?**

Parameters
====

| key                                      | value                                                        | description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type` (**required**)                    | `nlp`                                                        |                                                              |
| `contextDescription` (**TODO required**) | string. default:  `Answer the question as truthfully and concisely as possible using the provided context, and if the answer is not contained within the text below, say "I don\'t know."` <br/>**QUESTION FOR REVIEWER**: can I assume this parameter DOESN"T override the end of the default context description which is`\n\nContext:\n\n` ? | Overwrites the default context description for all NLP methods in this config.  For example:<br/> - `The below context is an index card that describes a plant and its phenology information. Answer the question as truthfully and concisely as possible using the provided context, and if the answer is not contained within the text below, say "I don\'t know`.  <br/> - `The below context is an email. Assume the sender is always an automated system from an insurance broker`. <br/>For information about how Sensible generates context for each NLP method, see the Notes section of each NLP method. |
