Parameters
====

**Note:** You can override the following parameters for each field in a config that uses a Sensible Instruct method. For more information, see [Advanced prompt configuration](doc:prompt).

| key                    | value                                                        | description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| type (**required**)    | `nlp`                                                        |                                                              |
| query                  | object                                                       | For this object's parameters, see following table.           |
| nlpTable               | object                                                       | For this object's parameters, see following table.           |
| list                   | object                                                       | For this object's parameters, see following table.           |
| contextDescription     | string. default: `The below context is an excerpt from a document.` | Configures context's metadata. For details about context and chunks, see the Notes section.<br/>Overwrites the default context description for all Sensible Instruct methods in this config. For example:<br/>\- `The below context is an excerpt from an index card that contains botanical information about a single plant species, including phenology information.`<br/>\- `The below context is an excerpt from an email. Assume the sender is always an automated system from an insurance broker.` |
| pageHinting            | boolean                                                      | Configures context's metadata. For details about context and chunks, see the Notes section. <br/>Includes or or removes page metadata for each chunk from the prompt Sensible inputs to an LLM. For example, removes phrases like `The excerpt starts at the top of page 1 and ends at the bottom of page 1.` |
| chunkCount             | number. default: `5`                                         | Configures context's size. For details about context and chunks, see the Notes section.<br/>The number of top-scoring chunks Sensible combines as context for the prompt it poses to a large-language model (LLM).<br/>Often, chunk count and chunk size are related. For example, if you know that your target data are spread over 7-10 pages, and occupy a small portion of those pages, you can specify a chunk count of 10 and a quarter- or half-page chunk size. |
| chunkSize              | `0.5`, `1` default: `0.5`                                    | Configures context's size. For details about context and chunks, see the Notes section.<br/>The size of the chunks Sensible splits the document into, as a page fraction. For example, `0.5` specifies each chunk is half a page. <br/>Often, chunk count and chunk size are related. For example, if you know that the data you seek is contained in one cover page, you can set chunk size to 1 and a chunk count to 1. |
| chunkOverlapPercentage | `0`, `0.25`, `0.5` default: `0.5`                            | Configures context's size. For details about context and chunks, see the Notes section<br/>The extent to which chunks overlap, as a percentage of the chunks' height. For example, `0.5` specifies each chunk overlaps by half its height. <br/>Sensible recommends setting a non-zero overlap to avoid splitting data across chunks. Set overlap to 0 solely if you're confident that your document layout doesn't flow across page boundaries and you're using a one-page chunk size. |

**Query parameters**

See the following table for details about the Query object parameters:

| key                | value                                                        | description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| promptIntroduction | string. default: `Answer the question as truthfully and concisely as possible using the provided context, and if the answer is not contained within the text below, say \"I don't know.\"` | Overwrites the default text at the beginning of the prompt that Sensible submits to the LLM for each Query method in this config.<br/> For example:  `Answer the question as truthfully and concisely as possible using the provided context, and if the answer is not contained within the text below, say \"UNKNOWN\".`<br/>**Note** Sensible returns null for the Query method if the phrase `I don't know` is in the returned field value. If you alter this key phrase using this parameter, for example by asking the LLM to return a phrase like `UNKNOWN` , then Sensible returns a phrase like `UNKNWON` instead of null. |

**NLP Table parameters**

See the following table for details about the NLP Table object parameters:

| key                | value                                                        | description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| promptIntroduction | string. default: `Below is a sample table. Please transform the data from the sample table into the target table where the target table's column headers are provided. Please do not modify the target table's headers. If cells in the sample table don't contain data, leave the corresponding cell of the new table blank. Finally return the transformed table without the header and header seperator line.` | Overwrites the default text at the beginning of the prompt that Sensible submits to the LLM for each NLP Table method in this config. <br/> For example, overwrite with: `Below is a sample table. Please transform the data from the sample table into the target table where the target table's column headers are provided. Please do not modify the target table's headers. If the cells in the sample table don't contain data, populate the cell with \"NOT FOUND\". Finally return the transformed table without the header and header seperator line.` |

**List parameters**

See the following table for details about the List object parameters:

| key                | value                                                        | description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| promptIntroduction | string. default: `Using the provided context fill out the table below. If the context doesn't contain any of the described items, leave it empty.` | Overwrites the default text at the beginning of the prompt that Sensible submits to the LLM for each List method in this config.<br/>For example:<br/>`Using the provided context fill out the table below. If the context doesn't contain any of the described items, return \"NOT FOUND\ in each cell"` |

Examples
====

Example 1
---

The following example shows using the NLP preprocessor to describe the context for each field in the config.

**Config**

```json
{
  "preprocessors": [
    {
      "type": "nlp",
      "contextDescription": "the following context is an excerpt from an ID card for a presidential pet."
    }
  ],
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "pet_name",
      "method": {
        "id": "question",
        "question": "pet's name"
      },
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "id": "pet_owner",
      "method": {
        "id": "question",
        "question": "usa president who owned this pet"
      },
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "id": "tenure",
      "method": {
        "id": "question",
        "question": "for what date range was this pet in the white house"
      },
      "type": "string"
    }
  ],
}
```

Notes
===

For each Sensible Instruct method, Sensible creates a full prompt for a large-language method (LLM) that includes your prompts and *context*, or chunks excepted from a document.

- For information about configuring the full prompt that Sensible inputs to an LLM, see [Advanced prompt configuration](doc:prompt).
- For information about how Sensible generates context, see the SenseML reference topic for each Sensible Instruct method, for example, [List](https://docs.sensible.so/docs/list#notes).
