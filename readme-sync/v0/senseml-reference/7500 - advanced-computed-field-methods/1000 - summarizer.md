title: "Summarizer"
hidden: false
---
Automatically extracts key/value pairs from short snippets of free text using [OpenAI's GPT-3 completion API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/). The Summarizer computed field method takes as input a snippet of free text extracted using the [Topic](doc:topic) method, and extracts key/value pairs informed by short samples of extracted values you provide. 

Parameters
====

The following parameters are in the computed field's [global Method](doc:computed-field-methods#parameters) parameter: 


| key                      | value        | description                                                  |
| :----------------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| id (**required**)        | `summarizer` |                                                              |
| source_id (**required**) | field ID     | Specifies a field whose output is a snippet of text with the key/value information you want to extract. If the snippet doesn't occur at a predictable location in the document, then you can use the [Topic](doc:topic) method to find it. |
| fields                   | string array | Names of the keys you want to extract. These names have an impact on the free-text extraction, so choose names that have a meaningful relationship to the target data to extract. For example, for a dollar amount of rent to extract,  `rent`, `rents`, and `rent_in_dollars` are good naming choices. |
| samples                  | object array | Short snippets of text containing examples of how to extract information. Contains these parameters:<br/>`prompt` (string): A free-text example of the information you want to extract.<br/>`values` (string array):  The target information to extract from this prompt. This array is a parallel array to the Fields parameter's array (the same length and same sequence). If GPT-3 can't find the target information in the Source ID parameter, it can generate an arbitrary value. To override this behavior, specify a Sample parameter whose Prompt parameter has a text snippet that's missing the target data, and whose Values array indicates the data is missing (for example, each item in the array is "N/A" or "not found").<br/> |

Examples

The following example shows using the Summarizer method to extract the monthly rent and the payment frequency from a lease.
