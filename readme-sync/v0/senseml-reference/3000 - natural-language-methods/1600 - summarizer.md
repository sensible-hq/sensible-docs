title: "Summarizer"
hidden: false
---
Automatically extracts key/value pairs from short snippets of free text using an LLM (GPT-3.5 Turbo). The Summarizer computed field method takes as input a snippet of free text, and extracts key/value pairs based on instructions or short samples of extracted values you provide. 

Example use cases for this method include:

- To transform another method's output when you can't use [types](doc:types) or other [computed field methods](doc:computed-field-methods). For example, if you use the [Row](doc:row) method to return an inconsistently formatted ranking (`first`, `1st`,  `1`), then you can use this method to consistently format the ranking. You can reformat with instructions like `the following snippet is a ranking. Return it formatted liked \"1st\", \"2nd\", \"3rd\" and so forth, not written out like \"first\" or in digit-only format like \"1\" `. 

- As an alternative to the List method. For a comparison of these methods, see the following table:

| Summarizer method                                            | List method                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ❌ Requires an input field to find the text snippet containing the answer. Typically, the input field uses the [Topic](doc:topic) or [Document Range](doc:document-range) methods. | ✅ finds the text snippet containing the answer automatically |
| ✅ returns a multiple-answer response structured as an object or list of objects | ✅ returns a multiple-answer response structured as an object or list of objects |

Parameters
====

The following parameters are in the computed field's [global Method](doc:computed-field-methods#parameters) parameter: 


| key                      | value        | description                                                  |
| :----------------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| id (**required**)        | `summarizer` | The Anchor parameter is optional for fields that use this method. If you omit an anchor, Sensible searches the entire document for the data you want to extract. |
| source_id (**required**) | field ID     | Specifies a field whose output is a snippet of text with the key/value information you want to extract. If the snippet doesn't occur at a predictable location in the document, then you can use the [Topic](doc:topic) method to find it. |
| fields (**required**)    | string array | Names of the keys you want to extract. These names have an impact on the free-text extraction, so choose names that have a meaningful relationship to the target data to extract. For example, for a dollar amount of rent to extract,  `rent`, `rents`, and `rent_in_dollars` are good naming choices. |
| instructions             | string       | Natural-language instructions about how to extract information from the text in the Source ID parameter.<br/>For more information about how to write instructions (or "prompts"), see [Best practices for prompt engineering with OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api).<br/>For an example of using this parameter, see the Examples section. |
| samples                  | object array | Short snippets of text similar to the text in the Source ID parameter, with examples of the information to extract. <br/>Use in addition to the Instructions parameter to increase the LLM's accuracy. <br/>Contains these parameters:<br/>`prompt` (string): An example of the sort of free text from which you want to extract data.<br/>`values` (string array):  The target information to extract from this prompt. This array is a parallel array to the Fields parameter's array. Parallel arrays are the same length and same sequence. If the LLM can't find the target information in the Source ID parameter, it can generate an arbitrary value. To override this behavior, specify a Sample parameter whose Prompt parameter has a text snippet that's missing the target data, and whose Values array indicates the data is missing (for example, "N/A" or "not found").<br/>For an example of using this parameter, see the Examples section. |

China accounts for more than 50 percent of 2022/23 global ending stocks but its stocks are largely not available to the public. When China is removed from the global picture, stocks are even tighter at 123.5 MMT, the lowest since 2007/08. Major exporters' stocks are forecasted down 0.1 MMT to 55.6 MMT. Stocks in Australia are raised 0.5 MMT to 3.7 MMT with higher domestic production. Despite a production decline Argentina's stocks are raised 0.2 MMT to 1.4 MMT as exports will be limited with restricted supplies. Higher exports for the European Union and Kazakhstan cut their ending stocks by 0.5 MMT to 9.5 MMT and 0.2 MMT to 1.2 MMT, respectively. Stronger food use in the United States results in lower ending stocks (-0.1 MMT to 15.5 MMT). Canada, Ukraine, and Russia's stocks remain anchored at 4.2 MMT, 4.7 MMT, and 15.4 MMT, respectively. Stocks for India are raised 0.5 MMT to 12.0 MMT as exports remain restricted, but this still would be the tightest in 6 years. Figure 10 Global ending stocks, 2016/17–2022/23"
