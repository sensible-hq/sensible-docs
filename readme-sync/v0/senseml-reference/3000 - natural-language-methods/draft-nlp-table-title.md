 In detail:

-  Sensible extracts lines contained in a rectangular region immediately above each table, since that region is likely to contain the table title. 
-  The height of that region equals the line height of the first non-empty cell of the table + 0.1 inches, and the region extends down to the top boundary of the table.
-  For information about how Sensible determines if lines are "contained" in a region, see [Region](doc:region).
