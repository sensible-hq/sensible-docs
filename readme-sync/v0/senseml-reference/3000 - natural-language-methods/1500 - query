title: "Query"
hidden: false

---

Extracts individual facts in a document, such as the date of an invoice, the liability limit of an insurance policy, or the destination address of a shipping container delivery. It can find these facts in paragraphs of free text or in more structured layouts, for example key/value pairs or tables.

Sensible recommends framing each query, or prompt, so that it has a single, short answer.  For complex prompts with multi-part answers, use the [List method](doc:list) or the  [Summarizer](doc:summarizer) method. 

For tips and troubleshooting, see [Query tips](doc:query-tips).

For more information about how this method works, see [Notes](doc:question#notes).

Parameters
=====

**Note:** For the full list of parameters available for this method, see [Global parameters for methods](doc:method#section-global-parameters-for-methods). The following table only shows parameters most relevant to or specific to this method.

**Note** You can configure some the following parameters in both the [NLP](doc:nlp) preprocessor and in a field's method. If you configure both, the field's parameter overrrides the NLP preprocessor's parameter. For more information, see [Advanced prompt configuration](doc:prompt).

| key                     | value                                                        | description                                                  |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| id (**required**)       | `question`                                                   | The Anchor parameter is optional for fields that use this method. If you specify an anchor, Sensible ignores it. |
| question (**required**) | string                                                       | A free-text question about information in the document. For example, `"what's the policy period?"` or `"what's the client's first and last name?"`.  For more information about how to write questions (or "prompts"), see [Best practices for prompt engineering with OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api). |
| chunkScoringText        | string                                                       | Configures context's content. For details about context and chunks, see the Notes section.<br/>A representative snippet of text from the part of the document where you expect to find the answer to your prompt. Use this parameter to narrow down the page location of the answer to your prompt. For example, if your prompt has multiple candidate answers, and the correct answer is located near unique or distinctive text that's difficult to incorporate into your question, then specify the distinctive text in this parameter.<br/>If specified, Sensible uses this text to find top-scoring chunks. If unspecified, Sensible uses the prompt to score chunks.<br/>Sensible recommends that the snippet is specific to the target chunk, semantically similar to the chunk, and structurally similar to the chunk. <br/>For example,  if the chunk contains a street address formatted with newlines, then provide a snippet with an example street address that contains newlines, like `123 Main Street\nLondon, England`. If the chunk contains a street address in a free-text paragraph, then provide an unformatted street address in the snippet.<br/>For an example, see [Example 3](doc:question#example-3).<br/> |
| promptIntroduction      | string. default: `Answer the question as truthfully and concisely as possible using the provided context, and if the answer is not contained within the text below, say \"I don't know.\"` | Overwrites the default text at the beginning of the prompt that Sensible submits to the LLM for this field.<br/>For example: `Answer the question as truthfully and concisely as possible using the provided context, and if the answer is not contained within the text below, say \"UNKNOWN\".",`<br/>**Note** Sensible returns null if the phrase `I don't know` is in the returned field value. If you alter this key phrase using this parameter, for example by asking the LLM to return a phrase like `UNKNOWN` , then Sensible returns a phrase like `UNKNWON` instead of null. |
| contextDescription      | string. default: `The below context is an excerpt from a document.` | Overwrites the default context description for this field. For example:<br/>\- `The below context is an excerpt from an index card that contains botanical information about a single plant species, including phenology information.`<br/>\- `The below context is an excerpt from an email. Assume the sender is always an automated system from an insurance broker.`<br/>For information about how Sensible generates context, see the SenseML reference topic for each Sensible Instruct method, for example, [List](https://docs.sensible.so/docs/list#notes). |
| pageHinting             | boolean                                                      | Configures context metadata. For details about context and chunks, see the Notes section. <br/>Includes or or removes page metadata for each chunk from the prompt Sensible inputs to an LLM. For example, removes phrases like `The excerpt starts at the top of page 1 and ends at the bottom of page 1.` |
| chunkCount              | number. default: `5`                                         | Configures context's size. For details about context and chunks, see the Notes section.<br/>The number of top-scoring chunks Sensible combines as context for the prompt it poses to a large-language model (LLM).<br/>Often, chunk count and chunk size are related. For example, if you know that your target data are spread over 7-10 pages, and occupy a small portion of those pages, you can specify a chunk count of 10 and a quarter- or half-page  chunk size. |
| chunkSize               | `0.5`, `1` default: `0.5`                                    | Configures context's size. For details about context and chunks, see the Notes section.<br/>The size of the chunks Sensible splits the document into, as a page fraction. For example, `0.5` specifies each chunk is half a page. <br/>Often, chunk count and chunk size are related. For example, if you know that the data you seek is contained in one cover page, you can set chunk size to 1 and a chunk count to 1. |
| chunkOverlapPercentage  | `0`, `0.25`, `0.5` default: `0.5`                            | Configures context's size. For details about context and chunks, see the Notes section<br/>The extent to which chunks overlap, as a percentage of the chunks' height. For example, `0.5` specifies each chunk overlaps by half its height. <br/>Sensible recommends setting a non-zero overlap to avoid splitting data across chunks. Set overlap to 0 solely if you're confident that your document layout doesn't flow across page boundaries and you're using a one-page chunk size. |

Notes
===

For an overview of how this method works, see the following steps:

- To meet GPT-3's character limit for input, Sensible splits the document into equal-sized, overlapping chunks.
- Sensible scores each chunk by its similarity to either the `question` or the `chunkScoringText` parameters. Sensible scores each chunk using the OpenAPI Embeddings API.
- Sensible selects a number of the top-scoring chunks and combines them. The chunks can be non-consecutive in the document. Sensible deduplicates overlapping text in consecutive chunks. If you set chunk-related parameters so that the context exceeds GPT-3's character limit, Sensible automatically reduces the chunk count until the context meets the character limit.
- Sensible creates a full prompt for GPT-3 that includes the chunks and your prompt. For more information about the full prompt, see [Advanced prompt configuration](doc:prompt).
