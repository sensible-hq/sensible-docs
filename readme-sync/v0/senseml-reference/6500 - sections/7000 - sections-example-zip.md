Advanced: Zip table sections
====



The following example shows zipping multiple tables together by treating each table as a section group and each row or column as a section.

As an overview, this example shows creating a  `zipped_vehicle_description_and_coverages` array, where each  object in the array contains information from the vehicles table and from the limitations table in the following image:

 It also illustrates the following sections behavior:

- Splitting tables into sections, where each section is a row, agnostic of the text in the table.  For an illustration of this behavior, see [Section nuances](doc:section-nuances#multiple-anchors-in-section).
- Uses the Column Selection parameter in a vertical sections group to make sections out of table "slices". For more information about the Column Selection parameter, see [Section nuances](doc:section-nuances#column-selection).
- Using SenseML execution order to output the zipped section group and suppress the source section groups. See [Field extraction order](doc:field-order).
