This Sensible Instruct method extracts an individual fact in a document, such as the date of an invoice, the liability limit of an insurance policy, or the destination address of a shipping container delivery.

### Prompt Tips

- Try framing each prompt so that it has a single, short answer such as:

  - "company address"
  - "name of recipient"
  - "document date"

- See the following resources for creating prompts:

  -  [Prompt engineering](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)
  -  [Introduction to prompt engineering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/prompt-engineering)
  -  [Short course: Building systems with the ChatGPT API](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-systems-with-chatgpt/) and [Short course: ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/). 

- You can narrow down your search and disambiguate between multiple possible answers by adding location information to prompts:
  
	**Location relative to page number and position on page**

  - "address in the **top left of the first page** of the document"

  - "What is the medical paid value on the **last claim of the second page**?"

  - "consumer electronics device with highest sales mentioned **near end of document**"

    **Location relative to content in document**

  - "total amount **in the expense table**"

  - "phone number after **section 2**"

## Troubleshooting

- For information about troubleshooting error messages about prompts, see [Qualifying LLM accuracy](doc:confidence).

- You can view the source text for an LLM's answer highlighted in the document. In the Sensible Instruct editor, click the **Location** button in the output of a query field to view its source text in the document. For more information about how location highlighting works and its limitations, see [Location highlighting](doc:query#notes).

To try out this example in the Sensible app, take the following steps: 

1. Download the following example document:

   | Example document | [Download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/summarizer_crop.pdf) |
   | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

2. Create a test document type in the Sensible app, then click the document type you created to edit it. In the document type's **Reference documents** tab, upload the example document you downloaded in a previous step.

3. Click the document type's **Configurations** tab, create a new test configuration, and click the configuration you created to edit it.

4. Click **Sensible Instruct** and create fields to extract data using the following table:

| Field name                     | Method | Prompt                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| report_date                    | Query  | "for which month and year does this report describe wheat production. look in beginning of the document for the answer" |
| change_in_production           | Query  | "by what amount did US wheat production estimate change this month? if it didn't change, respond with 'no change'"" |
| seed_use                       | Query  | "what was US wheat seed use this year in the US in millions of bushels?" |
| seed_use_change                | Query  | "by what amount did US wheat seed use change this year, in million bushels? Use a negative sign for negative change and a positive sign for positive change" |
| global_wheat_production_change | Query  | by what amount did global wheat production change this year, measured in MMT? look near the end of the document for the answer" |
