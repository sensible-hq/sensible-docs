This LLM-based method extracts a table in a document based on your description of the table title and each of its column headers.

### Prompt Tips

- Extract all columns to get the best results. If you describe only a few of the columns, your results may be less accurate.

- Use the table titles or table column headers in the document as descriptions.

- For more information about how to write descriptions, or "prompts", see [Query Group](doc:query-group-tips).

- For advanced options, see [Advanced prompt configuration](doc:prompt).
