Sensible offers you several ways to troubleshoot your configs and extractions.

API logging levels
----

To troubleshoot extractions in API or SDK responses, you can add a verbosity level to a config. For more information, see [verbosity](doc:verbosity).


Inspect extracted text
-----

Sometimes, the text you see in the rendered document doesn't match the direct-text extraction. To inspect all the text Sensible extracted from a document, use the following config:

```json
{  
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "all_lines_in_doc",
      "method": {
        "id": "documentRange",
        "includeAnchor": true
      },
      "anchor": {
        "match": {
          "type": "first"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Inspect lines and fields
----

You can inspect a line to see:

- the extracted text (this text might not match the text in the rendered document)
- dimensions of the line boundaries
- which fields interact with that line:

Inspect SenseML
-----

The Sensible app visually represents SenseML queries in rendered documents using colored symbols. For more information, see [UI guide](doc:color).

Lint SenseML
----

The SenseML pane has a built-in linter for both JSON and the SenseML model. If you see a warning about  invalid JSON, then hover over the red-underlined JSON to see an error message:

You can also use the linter to autocomplete parameters.
