**Troubleshooting**

Sensible returns the following error messages when the LLM is uncertain about the accuracy of the extracted data. Note that LLMs can inaccurately report uncertainties. For more information, see [Accuracy measures](doc:accuracy-measures).

| Answer might not fully answer the question | The context that Sensible provides to the LLM might not have the full answer. | - Tweak the context that Sensible provides to the LLM using  [chunk parameters](doc:question#parameters).<br/> - Simplify your question, for example, break it up into multiple questions. |
| Answer not found in the context            | The context that Sensible provides to the LLM doesn't contain the answer. | - Tweak the context that Sensible provides to the LLM using  [chunk parameters](doc:question#parameters).<br/> |
| Ambiguous query                            | The LLM doesn't understand your question.                    | Rephrase your query using the tips in the tips section.      |

To try out this example in the Sensible app, take the following steps: 

1. Download the following example PDF:

   | Example PDF | [Download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/summarizer_crop.pdf) |
   | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

2. Create a test document type in the Sensible app, then click the document type you just created to edit it. In the document type's **Reference documents** tab, upload the example PDF you just downloaded.

3. Click the document type's **Configurations** tab, create a new test configuration, and click the configuration you just created to edit it.

4. Click **Sensible Instruct** and create fields to extract data using the following table:

| Field name                     | Method | Describe what you want to extract                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| report_date                    | Query  | "for which month and year does this report describe wheat production. look in beginning of the document for the answer" |
| change_in_production           | Query  | "by what amount did US wheat production estimate change this month? if it didn't change, respond with 'no change'"" |
| seed_use                       | Query  | "what was US wheat seed use this year in the US in millions of bushels?" |
| seed_use_change                | Query  | "by what amount did US wheat seed use change this year, in million bushels? Use a negative sign for negative change and a positive sign for positive change" |
| global_wheat_production_change | Query  | by what amount did global wheat production change this year, measured in MMT? look near the end of the document for the answer" |
