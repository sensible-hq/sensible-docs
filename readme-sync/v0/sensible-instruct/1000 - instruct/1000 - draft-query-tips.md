| Answer might not fully answer the question | The context that Sensible provides to the LLM might not have the full answer. | - Tweak the context that Sensible provides to the LLM using  [chunk parameters](doc:question#parameters).<br/> - Simplify your question, for example, break it up into multiple questions. |
| Answer not found in the context            | The context that Sensible provides to the LLM doesn't contain the answer. | - Tweak the context that Sensible provides to the LLM using  [chunk parameters](doc:question#parameters).<br/> |
| Ambiguous query                            | The LLM identified ambiguities in your question.             | Rephrase your question using the tips in the tips section.   |
