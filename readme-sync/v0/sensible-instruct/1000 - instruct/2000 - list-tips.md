title: "List extraction tips"

---
This Sensible Instruct method extracts repeating data in a document based on your description of the listâ€™s overall contents and each individual item. Data such as the work history or skills on a resume, the vehicles on an auto insurance policy, or the line items on an invoice are best suited for this method. 

This method is an alternative to the [Table](doc:table-tips) method, when the data you want can appear either as a table or as another layout. The List method can find data in paragraphs of free text or in more structured layouts, such as key/value pairs or tables.  

**Tips**

- The list description should describe the overall contents for the list, while each property should be a single, short description.
- For more information about how to write instructions (or "prompts") for this method's Description parameters, see [Best practices for prompt engineering with OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api).

To try out this example in the Sensible app, take the following steps: 

1. Download the following example PDF:

   | Example PDF | [Download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/list.pdf) |
   | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

2. Create a test document type in the Sensible app, then click the document type you just created to edit it. In the document type's **Reference documents** tab, upload the example PDF you just downloaded.

3. Click the document type's **Configurations** tab, create a new test configuration, and click the configuration you just created to edit it.

4. Click **Sensible Instruct** and create fields to extract data using the following table:

| Field name | Method | Overall list description                                     | Property ids and descriptions                                |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| dinners    | List   | "dinner special menu items"                                  | **dinner description** - "entree description"<br/><br/>**price** - "dinner price" |
| desserts   | List   | "dessert special menu items"                                 | **dessert description** - "dessert description"<br/><br/>**price** - "dessert price" |
| wines      | List   | "red wines and white wines (not other drinks such as beers or liquors)" | **wine_name** - "wine brand name"<br/><br/>**wine_type** - "wine varietal name (not brand), for example, return 'Red:cabernet savignon' or 'white:varietal not found'"<br/><br/>**wine_description** - "wine description"<br/><br/>**smallest_serving_price** - "smallest wine serving size and its dollar price, formatted like '6 oz: $11'"<br/><br/>**second_smallest_serving_price** - "second-smallest wine serving size and its dollar price, formatted like '6 oz: $11'"<br/><br/>**bottle_price** - "price per bottle, in dollars" |

For example, use the following screenshot as a guide for configuring the `dinners` field:
