Extracts TBD TODO test 

For more information about how to write instructions (or "prompts") for the Table method's Description parameters, see [Best practices for prompt engineering with OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api).

**Tips**

Partially extracted tables may not be accurately captured. Try extracting all columns to get the best results.

Try framing each description as the exact title and column headers in the table.

You can improve results by being more specific:

- Budget column in the expense table
- Transaction amount column in the last column of the summary table
- Vehicle make (not model)
