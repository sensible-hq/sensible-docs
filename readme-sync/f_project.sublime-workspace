For example, configure this when the section lacks an easy-to-match first line.<br/><br/>**vertical sections:** Specifies the number of inches to offset the section *group's* top boundary from the anchor Match parameter. For example, configure this when when you want to exclude non-columnar text from a vertical section.<br/><br/> |\n   56: | stopOffsetY           | number in inches                                   | Specifies the number of inches to offset from the Stop parameter. <br/><br/>**horizontal sections:**  Offsets each section's stop from the Stop horizontal line.<br><br/>**vertical sections:** Offsets the section *group's* stop from the Stop horizontal line. |\n   57  \n   58  ### Range parameters for columns\n   ..\n   67  | columnSelection | array of index selections where each \"index selection\" can be:<br/>- a column index or comma-delimited indices<br><br>- an array with two comma-delimited indices, meaning all the columns in the indices range<br/><br/> default: capture all columns (`[]`) | Use to configure which c... <skipped 295 characters> ...lines from any other columns to each section. <br/>`[1,3,-1]`  selects 2nd, 4th, and the last columns.

Or, use an `xRangeFilter` parameter in the [Document Range method](doc:document-range) to capture the limits.  \n  429  - What if the document listed emails, and you just wanted to capture all those emails?
