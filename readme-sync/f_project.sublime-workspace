For example, configure Sensible to return errors if a quoted rate is null, a broker's email isn't in string@string format, or if a zip code has more than 5 digits.  For more information, see [Validate extractions](doc:validate-extractions).  \n   10  - **OCR confidence scores**: Get a score for the quality of text images. For example, check that text in a scanned or photographed document isn't blurry or illegible.  For more information, see [Validate extractions](doc:validate-extractions).  \n   11: - **Confidence signals**: For data extracted by large-language models (LLMs), Sensible asks the LLM to report any uncertainties it has about the accuracy of the extracted data. For example, an LLM can report that it found multiple answer candidates. For more information, see [Qualifying LLM accuracy](doc:confidence).\n   12  \n   13  - **Extraction coverage:**  A score that measures how fully an extraction captured all the data in the document. It's a percentage comparing non-null, [validated](doc:validate-extractions) fields to total fields returned by a config for a document. For example, a coverage score of 70% for an extraction with no validation errors means that 30% of fields were null.

The number of chunks Sensible sumbits to the LLM can therefore be smaller than the number specified by the Chunk Count parameter.\n  455: 3. To avoid large-language model (LLM)'s token limits, Sensible batches the chunks into groups by page numbers. Sensible batches a maxiumum of 20 page numbers. The chunks in each page group can be non-consecutive in the document.\n  456  4. For each page group, Sensible submits a full prompt to the LLM that includes the pages' chunks as context, page-hinting data, and your prompts. For information about the LLM model, see the LLM Engine parameter. For more information about the full prompt, see [Advanced prompt configuration](doc:prompt). The full prompt instructs the LLM to create a list formatted as a table, based on the context.\n  457  5. Sensible concatenates the results from the LLM for each page group and returns a list, formatted as a table.\n\nC:\\Users\\franc\\Documents\\GitHub\\sensible-docs\\readme-sync\\v0\\senseml-reference\\3000 - natural-language-methods\\1500 - query-group.md:\n    5  ---\n    6  \n    7: Extracts individual facts in a document, such as the date of an invoice, the liability limit of an insurance policy, or the destination address of a shipping container delivery.

For example, configure Sensible to return errors if a quoted rate is null, a broker's email isn't in string@string format, or if a zip code has more than 5 digits.  For more information, see [Validate extractions](doc:validate-extractions).  \n   10  - **OCR confidence scores**: Get a score for the quality of text images. For example, check that text in a scanned or photographed document isn't blurry or illegible.  For more information, see [Validate extractions](doc:validate-extractions).  \n   11: - **Confidence signals**: For data extracted by large-language models (LLMs), Sensible asks the LLM to report any uncertainties it has about the accuracy of the extracted data. For example, an LLM can report that it found multiple answer candidates. For more information, see [Qualifying LLM accuracy](doc:confidence).\n   12  \n   13  - **Extraction coverage:**  A score that measures how fully an extraction captured all the data in the document. It's a percentage comparing non-null, [validated](doc:validate-extractions) fields to total fields returned by a config for a document. For example, a coverage score of 70% for an extraction with no validation errors means that 30% of fields were null.

You'll write JSON to tell Sensible about which data to extract from an example document, using what you know about the layout of the document. SenseML uses a mix of techniques, including machine learning, heuristics, and rules, to extract your target information.\n    8  \n    9  You can then save your descriptions as a \"config.\" Publish your config to automate extracting from similar documents.   \n   ..\n   88            {\n   89              /* ask a free-text question.\n   90:            You can author LLM-based queries in Sensible Instruct\n   91             instead of in JSON */\n   92              \"id\": \"bodily_injury_premium\",\n   ..\n  195  - If you want to skip ahead and try out the API or SDKs, see [Integrate with your application](doc:getting-started#integrate-with-your-application). \n  196  \n  197: How layout-based extraction works\n  198  ====\n  199  \n  200: This guide focuses on layout-based document extraction, which works as follows:\n  201  \n  202  - Each \"field\" is a basic query unit in Sensible.  Each field outputs a piece of data from the document that you want to extract. Sensible uses the field `id` as the key in the key/value JSON output. For more information, see [Field](doc:field-query-object).\n  ...\n  206  - Then, Sensible uses a \"method\" to expand its search out from the anchor and extract the data you want. For more information about methods, see [Methods](doc:methods).\n  207  \n  208: This config uses three types of layout-based methods:\n  209  \n  210    | Type of method | explanation                                                  | description                                       |\n  ...\n  215  \n  216  \n  217: This config also uses one large language model (LLM)-based method, to demonstrate that you can combine layout-based and LLM-based methods in the same config:\n  218  \n  219  | Type of method   | explanation                                                  | description                                                  |\n  220  | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n  221: | LLM-based | [How it works: query group method](doc:getting-started#how-it-works-query-group-method) | Ask a free-text question about simple information in the document |\n  222  \n  223  How it works: Query Group method\n  ...\n  241            {\n  242              /* ask a free-text question.\n  243:            You can author LLM-based queries in Sensible Instruct\n  244             instead of in JSON */\n  245              \"id\": \"bodily_injury_premium\",\n  ...\n  276  Try it out: change one of the questions to `\"street address for the Anyco insurance company\"` and see what you get.

You could use a regular expression (regex) in a `\"match\":\"all\"` anchor coupled with a [Passthrough method](doc:passthrough), or the [Regex method](doc:regex).\n  451  - You can split the policy period into two dates, either by using the [Split computed field method](doc:split), or by setting the [Date](doc:types#date) type on the field and using a tiebreaker.\n  452  \n\nC:\\Users\\franc\\Documents\\GitHub\\sensible-docs\\readme-sync\\v0\\senseml-reference\\2000 - field-query-object\\1100 - match.md:\n  216        /* to show matching behavior, output all matching\n  217           anchor lines, not just the first match */\n  218:       \"match\": \"all\",\n  219        \"method\": {\n  220          /* to show matching behavior, use passthrough\n  ...\n  239                   but NOT \"should not\" */\n  240                {\n  241:                 \"type\": \"all\",\n  242                  \"matches\": [\n  243                    {\n\nC:\\Users\\franc\\Documents\\GitHub\\sensible-docs\\readme-sync\\v0\\senseml-reference\\2000 - methods\\1700 - passthrough.md:\n   31      {\n   32        \"id\": \"forms_with_4_numbers\",\n   33:       \"match\": \"all\",\n   34        \"anchor\": {\n   35          \"start\": {\n\nC:\\Users\\franc\\Documents\\GitHub\\sensible-docs\\readme-sync\\v0\\senseml-reference\\5000 - preprocessors\\1450 - scale.md:\n   53        \"id\": \"white_house_tenure\",\n   54        \"anchor\": \"tenure\",\n   55:       \"match\": \"all\",\n   56        \"method\": {\n   57          \"id\": \"region\",\n\nC:\\Users\\franc\\Documents\\GitHub\\sensible-docs\\readme-sync\\v0\\senseml-reference\\6000 - computed-field-methods\\1350 - pick-values.md:\n   89        \"method\": {\n   90          \"id\": \"pickValues\",\n   91:         \"match\": \"all\",\n   92          \"value\": \"yes\",\n   93          \"source_ids\": [\n\nC:\\Users\\franc\\Documents\\GitHub\\sensible-docs\\readme-sync\\v0\\senseml-reference\\6000 - computed-field-methods\\1500 - zip.md:\n    5  Zips one of the following:\n    6  \n    7: - Zips the output of array source fields into an array of objects.

For example, if you zip arrays that have 4, 5, and 6 elements respectively, the zipped array has 4 elements. Examples of source IDs that output arrays include fields with `\"match\": \"all\"` configured, and section groups. To ensure the longest source array isn't shortened when using `\"match\": \"all\"`, instead use  `\"match\":\"allWithNull\"` for all source fields.
