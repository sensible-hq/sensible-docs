If you specify Fast for the LLM Engine parameter,  1. Sensible selects a number of top-scoring chunks as determined by the Chunk Count parameter. 2. To improve performance, Sensible removes chunks that are significantly less relevant from the list of top-scoring chunks. The number of chunks Sensible sumbits to the LLM can therefore be smaller than the number specified by the Chunk Count parameter.\n  455  3. To avoid large language model (LLM)'s token limits, Sensible batches the chunks into groups by page numbers. Sensible batches a maxiumum of 20 page numbers.
