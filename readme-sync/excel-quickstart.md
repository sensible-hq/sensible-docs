If you're trying to convert a PDF into excel, you'll often find "solutions" that just spacially map the PDF layout onto a sheet. (image...) That's not very meaningful. If there's a table in a PDF, you want a table in excel, right?

Sensible can help you here by extracting document elements like boxes, tables, checkboxes, paragraphs, and even complex repeating section layouts, and outputting them to PDF sheets. (image) You can configure the process completely with a little bit of JSON knowledge, or follow this quickstart to see the process end-to-end in under a minute using our existing open-source library for converting common business forms such as auto insurance quotes from geico, etc (link) into excel sheets: 



If this library doesnt meet your needs, you can always develop your own PDF-to-excel flows for custom docs using SenseML.
